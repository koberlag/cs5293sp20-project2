Title: Epidemiology of virus-induced asthma exacerbations: with special reference to the role of human rhinovirus 
Summary: Therefore, HRV is potentially a causative agent of more severe ARI such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia (Turner and Couch, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2010; Smuts et al., 2011; Arakawa et al., 2012) , and may be associated with virus-induced asthma Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Fujitsuka et al., 2011; Smuts et al., 2011) . Table 1 shows the frequency of HRV infection in various adult respiratory diseases such as exacerbation of asthma (Nicholson et al., 1993; Atmar et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2003) , common cold (Makela et al., 1998; van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2005) , exacerbation of COPD (Seemungal et al., 2001; Rohde et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2003; Beckham et al., 2005; Papi et al., 2006; Hutchinson et al., 2007; Ko et al., 2007; McManus et al., 2008; Kherad et al., 2010; Dimopoulos et al., 2012; Perotin et al., 2013) , community acquired pneumonia (Jennings et al., 2008; Johnstone et al., 2008; Johansson et al., 2010; Lieberman et al., 2010; Fry et al., 2011; Wootton et al., 2011; Luchsinger et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2013; Huijskens et al., 2014) , exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Wootton et al., 2011) , and asymptomatic infection (Fry et al., 2011) .

Title: Crystal structure of the post-fusion core of the Human coronavirus 229E spike protein at 1.86 Å resolution 
Summary: Nevertheless, since HCoV-229E has a longer HR1 and HR2, the packing of its hydrophobic core and the buried interface between HR1 and HR2 differ from those in SARS and MERS (Supekar et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2004; Duquerroy et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2013) and are more similar to those in HCoV-NL63, another human -CoV (Zheng et al., 2006) . Compared with the 3HR1 cores of MERS, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, the SARS supercoils are less twisted, as shown by the longer pitch and larger hydrophobic voids in the middle of the 3HR1 core.

Title: a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology IFN-β-inducing, unusual viral RNA species produced by paramyxovirus infection accumulated into distinct cytoplasmic structures in an RNA-type-dependent manner 
Summary: The one-step growth kinetics of all the recombinants used above was previously reported to be similar to that of the parental Z-WT, except for 4C(-) and C /C(-), the titers of which were 1-2 logs lower than that of Z-WT throughout the time course, and viral protein synthesis in the infected cells did not significantly differ among the viruses examined (Kurotani et al., 1998; Irie et al., 2008a Irie et al., , 2010 . Total RNA samples prepared from cells infected with any of the IFN-β-inducing viruses, SeV-CNT, 4C(-), and NDV, were able to induce the granules as well as IFN-β in HeLa cells despite no formation of the granules by the CNT infection, whereas those from cells infected with the IFN-β-non-inducing SeV-Z-WT or treated with arsenite were not (Figure 4A) .

Title: Montelukast, an Anti-asthmatic Drug, Inhibits Zika Virus Infection by Disrupting Viral Integrity 
Summary: Briefly, BHK-21 cells confluent in six-well plates were infected with 50 pfu of virus at 37 • C. After 4 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and replaced with DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 µM of the montelukast. To evaluate whether montelukast could block the vertical transmission of ZIKV, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were infected with ZIKV as described previously (Wu et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017) and were then treated with montelukast or vehicle control.

Title: Development of Small-Molecule Inhibitors Against Zika Virus Infection 
Summary: For example, the ZIKV E protein is responsible for the binding of the virus to host cell receptors and mediating viral entry into the host cell; therefore, some small molecule inhibitors targeting the ZIKV E protein are effective in inhibiting virus attachment and entry (Byrd et al., 2013; Fernando et al., 2016; Oo et al., 2019) . AXL expressed on human glial cells can permit ZIKV binding and entry into the host glial cells (Nowakowski et al., 2016; Meertens et al., 2017) and small molecule compounds targeting AXL may be effective in inhibiting ZIKV infection (Rausch et al., 2017) .

Title: Alterations in stress granule dynamics driven by TDP-43 and FUS: a link to pathological inclusions in ALS? 
Summary: However, generally the focus is on TDP-43 and FUS (Andersson et al., 2008; Colombrita et al., 2009; Bosco et al., 2010; Freibaum et al., 2010; Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010; Dewey et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2011; Bentmann et al., 2012) . While many teams have analyzed the effect of mutant or wild type proteins on SG phenotypes using overexpression in a range of transformed cell lines (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010; Dewey et al., 2011; Baron et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2013) , there are only a handful that have examined the role of the endogenous proteins in SG dynamics (Colombrita et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011; Aulas et al., 2012 Aulas et al., , 2015 Blechingberg et al., 2012) .

Title: Immunoregulatory functions of immune complexes in vaccine and therapy 
Summary: In contrast to the conventional understanding that ICs formed in chronic infections cause inflammatory response by FccR cross-linking, it was recently found that in mice with clone 13 LCMV (long term) infection, the presence of ICs resisted CD4 + T-and B-cell depletion by anti-CD4 and anti-CD20 (rituximab) antibodies and blocked the activation of DCs by agonistic anti-CD40. When the concept was tested in a humanized mouse system with the Fc region of mouse CD20-specific mAb replaced with the human counterpart and a total replacement of mFccRs with hFccRs in the host, it was found that mutations in the Fc that allowed better binding to hFccRIIIa and IIa, as compared to IIIa alone protected the host to the best extent (DiLillo & Ravetch, 2015) .

Title: Targeting endosomal acidification by chloroquine analogs as a promising strategy for the treatment of emerging viral diseases 
Summary: The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of chloroquine analogs have also been beneficial in the treatment of viral infections and associated pathologies (Al-Bari 2015) . It is suggested that therapeutic agents like chloroquine analogs which are able to prevent the activation of macrophages and inhibit the secretion of TNF-a from various cells at clinically relevant concentrations (Al-Bari 2015) would confer some benefits in the treatment of viral infections.

Title: Of mice and men: the host response to influenza virus infection 
Summary: Based on the variation in IV-induced disease observed in the CC strains, we compared responses to IV infections in mouse and human by analyzing transcriptome changes in whole blood from infected CC strains and human patients. At the level of single genes, the mouse model very well reproduces the responses observed in human cohorts, for differential expression between infected and non-infected groups and with respect to the time course of expression.

Title: Noroviruses subvert the core stress granule component G3BP1 to promote viral VPg-dependent translation 
Summary: To further define the role of G3BP1 in the norovirus life cycle and to confirm that the function of G3BP1 was downstream of virus binding and viral entry, we therefore bypassed the entry phase of the infection process and transfected MNV VPg-linked RNA into WT and two independently generated BV2 DG3BP1 cell lines and examined the impact on norovirus replication. To assess a potential role for G3BP1 in the formation of VPg-driven translation complexes in cells, we examined the ability of GFP tagged versions of MNV VPg to pull down ribosomal proteins in the presence and absence of G3BP1.

Title: Terpene metabolic engineering via nuclear or chloroplast genomes profoundly and globally impacts off-target pathways through metabolite signalling 
Summary: Notably, because of differences in antibiotic selection when plants were initially grown (WT and N on antibiotic-free media and CN and C on spectinomycin-containing media), it is more meaningful to compare CN with C and WT with N. Given this, differences between CN and C are quite striking; despite both expressing high levels of Flag-SQS, CN had much more severe Evaluation of metabolic profiles of transgenic/ transplastomic lines expressing FPS and SQS Although our original intention was to produce transplastomic plants that accumulated squalene, phenotypes of all three lines suggested that more than just squalene levels might be altered. Importantly, transcriptomic data also showed no correlation between transgene expression and the effect on the expression of nuclear-encoded genes; the N line expressed up to 4000-fold less Flag-SQS than transplastomic lines (Figure 1d ) but affected more nuclear-encoded transcripts than C, and it had the strongest influence on the expression of certain transcripts (Tables 2 and 3) .

Title: Viral RNA switch mediates the dynamic control of flavivirus replicase recruitment by genome cyclization 
Summary: In agreement with the function of DENV4 UFS, we also showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral propagation of ZIKV, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores ZIKV propagation by IFA tests performed in transfected BHK-21 cells ( The duplex conformation of the UFS is required for robust NS5Pol binding and RdRp activity To understand the mechanism of how the UFS fulfills its role in vRNA replication, a series of in vitro assays were performed ( Figure 6 ). The differences in RdRp activity between WT mini-genome and the UFS mutants were likely caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, In supporting of this, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay ( Figure 3D) , and it has been reported that the base composition of U-rich sequence in the UFS was actually able to affect vRNA replication of DENV2 (Friebe and Harris, 2010) .Taken together, the above results demonstrated that genome cyclization disables the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, suggesting that the UFS has to function dynamically during vRNA replication.

Title: BIOLOGYjMEDICINE Viruses and viral proteins 
Summary: Recent data from Michael Rossmann and colleagues (Sun et al., 2014) demonstrate a novel mechanism of DNA delivery adopted by the tail-less coliphage 'X174 that requires the tubular structure of DNA pilot protein H to be wide enough to allow the passage of two antiparallel strands of ssDNA: this tube acts as a tail for the translocation of the viral genome, but it protrudes from the virion only at the time of infection. These structural comparisons revealed that, in addition to the active-site closure, the NV RdRP exhibits two other key changes: a rotation of the central helix in the thumb domain by 22 , resulting in the formation of a binding pocket for the primer RNA strand, and the displacement of the C-terminal tail region away from the central active-site groove, which also allows the rotation of the thumb helix (Fig.

Title: Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment 
Summary: Preference for a2,6-linked mammalian sialic acid receptors over a2,3-linked avian ones HA pH of activation HA avoids extracellular inactivation and undergoes conformational changes leading to membrane fusion at appropriate pH for human cells (5.0-5.4 or perhaps 5.5) (Russell, 2014) Polymerase complex efficiency Efficient replication in human cells (Cauldwell et al., 2014; Naffakh et al., 2008) Virus morphology Filamentous morphology associated with several adaptations to mammals (Seladi-Schulman et al., 2014; Seladi-Schulman et al., 2013; Campbell et al., 2014; Beale et al., 2014) Length of NA stalk Longer stalk of NA required to penetrate human mucus and deaggregate virions (Blumenkrantz et al., 2013) Antagonism of interferon production Species-specific binding of the NS1 protein to host factors (Rajsbaum et al., 2012) HA-NA "balance" Substrate selectivity and catalytic rate of NA are calibrated to "balance" avidity of HA for the cell-surface glycan receptor (Zanin et al., 2015; Baum and Paulson, 1991; Yen et al., 2011; Handel et al., 2014) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.18491.006 Glaser et al., 2005) ; most human H2 and H3 seasonal isolates (Connor et al., 1994; Matrosovich et al., 2000) *These anomalous results are speculated by the authors to be possibly, or even probably the result of laboratory adaptation to egg passage and may not reflect the properties of the primary isolate. Yet with only a few instances of pandemic strains emerging per century, it should not be surprising that a new pandemic strain would violate an apparent rule of human adaptation that applied perfectly to previous pandemic strains, as in the case of the PB2 residues associated with human adaptation in 2009, or as in the case of activation pH of HA in early 2009 isolates , which had a value outside the range previously seen in human influenza viruses.

Title: Emerging Concepts of Data Integration in Pathogen Phylodynamics 
Summary: The regression plots were rescaled for each virus such that the oldest genome in each dataset was set at time = 0 and the regression line has zero divergence at time = 0. to which we expect to observe genetic changes between viral sequences sampled at different times will depend on the overall rate of substitution (and its constancy), the length of the sequences that can be obtained and the differences in time of sampling. In the first section of this review, we focused on the integration of time and location with genetic data in a general phylogenetic framework, but these sources of information are sometimes also combined in different ways when the aim is to reconstruct transmission trees.

Title:  
Summary: To examine the contributions of V2-apex core epitope glycan and protein residues to binding by V2-apex bnAb iGL Ab versions, we generated MT145K strand C peptide and glycan trimer variants that are known to eliminate interactions of V2-apex bnAbs with the Env trimer (Andrabi et al., 2015; McLellan et al., 2011; Pancera et al., 2013) . Overall, the analysis of the immune responses revealed that, due to the extraordinary conservation of the V2-apex bnAb epitope region between HIV and chimpanzee SIV, the MT145K trimer successfully primed human V2-apex bnAb UCA-encoding mouse B cells and induced a V2-focused cross-neutralizing HIV Env-specific response that could be further boosted by HIV Env-derived trimers.

In the CC of cuprizone-treated mice the expression of the IGF-1 mRNA started to be up-regulated after 2 weeks of cuprizone feeding and peaked at weeks 4-5 corresponding to the maximal demyelination, proliferation of OPC and onset of their differentiation .

Title: Ambra1 spatially regulates Src activity and Src/FAK-mediated cancer cell invasion via trafficking networks 
Summary: In addition, we found that Ambra1 was present at focal adhesions at the cell-surface interface by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy; there was partial overlap with pSrc Y416 and FAK, suggesting that, as with other autophagy proteins we have reported previously (Sandilands et al., 2012a; Schoenherr et al., 2014) , there are pools of Ambra1 discretely present at sub-locations within focal adhesions (  We previously showed that active Src is localised to intracellular puncta containing autophagy proteins in FAK -/-SCC cells, allowing FAK-deficient cancer cells to cope with high levels of 'untethered' active Src (and other FAK-interacting tyrosine kinases, e.g. To determine whether IFITM3 was required for complex formation between active Src and Ambra1 in FAK-WT and -/-cells, we knocked down IFITM3 using a pool of siRNAs and analysed the interaction of Ambra1 and pSrc by co-immunoprecipitations ( Having verified that both Dynactin 1 and IFITM3 bind to Ambra1, we next addressed whether they were involved in the Ambra1-dependent intracellular trafficking of active pSrc.

Title: Bats and zoonotic viruses: can we confidently link bats with emerging deadly viruses? 
Summary: In most cases, the only evidence is the isolation or otherwise detection of the same viruses in bats and humans in areas where the diseases have emerged, but this does not mean that bats are the hosts for the viruses. The identification of the same virus in bats and humans might only be evidence that as mammals they are similar enough to serve as temporary hosts for the virus and the same virus can also be found in other terrestrial vertebrates (e.g., primates, antelopes, birds) and arthropods (Calisher et al.

Title: Protein quality control in the nucleolus safeguards recovery of epigenetic regulators after heat shock 
Summary: To verify the HS-induced accumulation of PcG proteins in the nucleolus, we isolated nucleoli from heat shocked and untreated GFP-CBX8 expressing K562 cells ( Figure 2A ). Taken together, these data show that, in parallel to the reallocation of chromatin remodelers and transcriptional regulators to the nucleolus, HS induces a quick reduction in PRC1 and PRC2 chromatin binding and changes in the epigenetic profile of PcG target genes with consequences for the transcriptional state of these genes.

Title: Biguanide is a modifiable pharmacophore for recruitment of endogenous Zn 2+ to inhibit cysteinyl cathepsins: review and implications 
Summary: Comparison of the active site of papain-like proteases with the structures of BAA and the phenformin-Zn 21 complex explains why one is a substrate for proteases; and the other is an inhibitor. The Zn 21 complex of phenformin is a prototype for design or discovery of other anti- Present analysis involves two interactions of the protease active site with metal complexes of biguanide derivatives: (a) the interaction of CysHis/ CysHis(X) catalytic partners with the coordinated metal cation and (b) the interaction of substratebinding sites with derivative moieties of the biguanide pharmacophore (schematized in Figs.

Title: A systematic view on influenza induced host shutoff 
Summary: These measurements and analysis reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is mainly driven by reduction in cellular mRNA levels, and that host mRNAs sensitivity to influenza is not uniform and certain mRNAs are more resistant to viral interference. smFISH measurements validate the RNA-seq quantification and reveal that cellular mRNA down regulation occurs in the nucleus Our global measurements implied that host shutoff is driven by the high levels of IAV mRNAs that outnumber cellular transcripts, and that some cellular mRNAs are less affected by IAV.

Title: Does mRNA structure contain genetic information for regulating co-translational protein folding? 
Summary: All the above findings were consistent with the model of co-translational protein folding as regulated by translational elongation rate, necessitating the validation of codon optimality and/or mRNA structure as a regulator of elongation rate. Combined with ribosomal profiling data, genomic profiles of RNA secondary structure supported the role of mRNA structure in modulating elongation speed (Tuller et al., 2010 (Tuller et al., , 2011 Yang et al., 2014) (but see Charneski & Hurst, 2013) .

Title: Habitat disturbance results in chronic stress and impaired health status in forest-dwelling paleotropical bats 
Summary: Bats (Chiroptera) are a promising taxon to study the effects of forest degradation, habitat loss and fragmentation on body condition, chronic stress and immunity, since bats are known to be highly sensitive to the effects of environmental change (Jones et al., 2009; Struebig et al., 2011; Meyer, et al., 2016) . Therefore, we predicted that foliageroosting bats from actively logged areas and fragmented forest exhibit lower body masses, signs of chronic stress, assessed by the neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L)-ratio (Davis et al., 2008) , and impaired immunity, measured as total white blood cell counts, compared with bats of recovering forest.

Title: A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 in the Cardiovascular and Central Nervous Systems 
Summary: On the other hand, due to the structural and functional heterogeneity of ADAM17 substrates, the sheddase is also involved in various pathological processes such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, cardiac failure, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and hypertension (Sandgren et al., 1990; Black et al., 1997; Peschon et al., 1998; Li et al., 2006; Ohtsu et al., 2006b; Zhan et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009; Scheller et al., 2011; Giricz et al., 2013; Menghini et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2013) .

Title: Expansion and Functional Divergence of AP2 Group Genes in Spermatophytes Determined by Molecular Evolution and Arabidopsis Mutant Analysis 
Summary: Because TOE2, TOE3, SMZ, and SNZ are only found in Brassicaceae, the analysis of positive selection of Brassicaceae AP2 group genes and five branches (AP2, TOE1, TOE2, TOE3, and SMZ/SNZ) was performed (Data sheet 3) , with the results revealing a lack of positive selection in the AP2 group genes of Brassicaceae, which indicates that the expansion of the number of AP2 group genes in Brassicaceae was not caused by positive selection. In the phylogenetic tree of all AP2 group genes in Brassicaceae (Figure 1 and Image 3), the relationship between clades SMZ and SNZ was paralogous and so were the relationships between the AP2 clade and the TOE3, TOE2, and SMZ/SNZ clades and the AP2 and TOE1 types.

Title: a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Classical Swine Fever Virus Infection Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagy to Sustain Viral Replication in vivo and in vitro 
Summary: Taken into consideration the results of pathological changes and viral loads, as well as activation of UPRs, our results showed that CSFV infection in vivo induces serious ER stress and autophagy in the organs with severer pathological changes and higher viral titers, while relatively mild ER stress and no autophagy was detectable in organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral titers, suggesting that CSFVinduced ER stress and autophagy are associated with the replication of CSFV in infected organs, and that CSFV-induced ER stress may be linked to autophagy, which needs to be further confirmed. Considering this inconformity, we further investigated the effect of ER stressmediated autophagy on CSFV replication in vitro, and found that treatment with ER stress agonists (TG) or autophagy inducer (RAPA) remarkably increased CSFV replication in cultured cells, however the replication of CSFV was significantly reduced in the cells incubated in the presence of ER stress inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) or autophagy inhibitor (3-MA), indicating that CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy are beneficial to its replication, which is consistent with our pervious findings (Pei et al., 2014; He et al., 2017) .

Title: Port d'Entrée for Respiratory Infections -Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria? 
Summary: As outlined above, many in vivo mice studies on bacterial and viral co-infections provided useful insights into severe pneumonia, including (i) the fact that viral infection primes the host for bacterial susceptibility leading to severe secondary infection (Hashimoto et al., 2007; Shahangian et al., 2009; Chaussee et al., 2011; Nakamura et al., 2011) , (ii) pathogen synergism (Tsai et al., 1998; McCullers and Rehg, 2002; Garcia-Suarez Mdel et al., 2007; Gurel et al., 2013; Mairpady Shambat et al., 2015; Zahlten et al., 2015) , (iii) enhanced inflammatory response at the onset of infection (Korteweg and Gu, 2008; Durbin et al., 2013; Pothlichet et al., 2013; Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014) leading to increased alveolar damage followed by immune paralysis with defective clearance of microorganisms (Shinya et al., 2006; van Riel et al., 2007 van Riel et al., , 2010 , and (iv) host receptor availability for sustained bacterial infection (Louria et al., 1959; Plotkowski et al., 1993; Cundell and Tuomanen, 1994; Puchelle et al., 2006; Korteweg and Gu, 2008) .

Title: Determination of host proteins composing the microenvironment of coronavirus replicase complexes by proximity-labeling

Importantly, besides the 513 host proteins that were enriched in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells, we noted that viral replicase gene products nsp2-10 and nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein were also significantly enriched in fractions derived from MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells, suggesting that they are all in close proximity to the BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein (Figure 2c , Figure 2d ).

Title: a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Nucleocytoplasmic transport of nucleocapsid proteins of enveloped RNA viruses 
Summary: Nuclear localization of the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV, Arteriviridae) appears to be essential for optimal virus replication and inhibition of cellular antiviral processes (Lee et al., 2006) ; in an analogous fashion, the successful production of infectious progeny of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, Paramyxoviridae) and Nipah virus (Paramyxoviridae) requires nuclear localization of the matrix (M) protein (Ghildyal et al., 2005 (Ghildyal et al., , 2009 Wang et al., 2010) . Thus, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, to the best of our knowledge, does not localize to the nucleus or the nucleolus of infected cells, in contrast to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses studied.

Summary: The level of antibody binding to postfusion hRSV F was even higher with sera from mice inoculated with F-416 and significantly higher (P < 0.001) than sera from mice inoculated with wild-type hMPV F. To assess whether the antibody binding to hRSV F observed with sera from mice inoculated with F-415 or F-416 was reflected in neutralizing activity against this virus, the mouse sera were tested in a microneutralization assay ( Fig 3B) .

Title: The Tudor SND1 protein is an m 6 A RNA reader essential for replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 
Summary: To test this hypothesis without the possible interference of NaB on ORF50 RNA decay, the decay of native (unspliced) ORF50 RNA was monitored in scramble and SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated into the lytic cycle for 24 hr before addition of actinomycin D. Strikingly, native ORF50 RNA was significantly more unstable in SND1-depleted cells (Figure 8b ) with~80% of ORF50 RNA remaining at 6 hr post-transcription inhibition in scramble cells and~50% in depleted cells. Removal of m 6 A in ORF50 RNA impairs SND1 binding to ORF50 RNA Due to the broad and overlapping m 6 A-seq peaks across the ORF50 RNA and the high frequency of DRm 6 ACH motifs throughout ORF50 RNA, we attempted to deplete global m 6 A levels in ORF50 RNA by stably depleting METTL3 in BCBL1 cells and assess its effect on lytic replication, however limited depletion was achieved and no significant effect on KSHV lytic replication was observed (data not shown).

The antigens produced in both of these studies were modified to remove the cleavage site which is now known to result in an aberrant structure, unless a flexible linker peptide is introduced at the interface of the gp120 and gp41 to retain the conformational mobility of the two subunits (Georgiev et al., 2015; Ringe et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2015) .

Title: a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Viral-Induced Enhanced Disease Illness 
Summary: Similar to DENV disease enhancement, the main cause of ADE in WNV infection is related to the presence of sub-neutralizing concentration of antibodies, which bind to the virion and facilitate its entry to cells bearing Fc-γ receptors (Pierson et al., 2007) . Surface proteins are the main antigenic determinants of antibody enhancing response, such as the HA of influenza (Ramakrishnan et al., 2016) , G protein of RSV, spike S protein in SARS (Kam et al., 2007) , E glycoprotein of flaviviruses (Bardina et al., 2017) , transmembrane GP of HIV (Robinson et al., 1990a) , GP of Ebola virus (Takada et al., 2001) , and E2 glycoprotein of HCV (Meyer et al., 2008) .

Title: MINI REVIEW Rhinovirus Biology, Antigenic Diversity, and Advancements in the Design of a Human Rhinovirus Vaccine 
Summary: In addition to causing upper respiratory infections, HRV has also been linked to development and shown to exacerbate asthma and lower respiratory tract infections in human asthmatic volunteers (Hicks et al., 2006; Malmstrom et al., 2006; Renwick et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2008 Jackson et al., , 2014 Message et al., 2008; Gern, 2010; Jacobs et al., 2013; Saraya et al., 2014) .

Title: Structural and Functional Insights into Small, Glutamine-Rich, Tetratricopeptide Repeat Protein Alpha 
Summary: SGTA was first identified in complex with viral proteins (Callahan et al., 1998; Cziepluch et al., 1998) and has emerged as a key regulator in macromolecular quality control, in addition to its established roles in the biogenesis of TA membrane proteins, and proposed roles in hormone receptor signaling (Leznicki and High, 2012; Leznicki et al., 2013; Philp et al., 2013; Wunderley et al., 2014) . This capability of the C-terminal domain facilitates interactions of SGTA in the BAG6 quality control cycle of MLPs, its ability to shield TMD helices of TA proteins facilitating their post-translational membrane integration, and its interaction with the cysteinestring protein, a chaperone implicated in neurotransmitter release (Tobaben et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010) .

Title: A Novel Mechanism Underlying the Innate Immune Response Induction upon Viral-Dependent Replication of Host Cell mRNA: A Mistake of +sRNA Viruses' Replicases 
Summary: The authors employed several EM techniques including electron tomography (ET) to obtain the 3-D analysis of the virus-induced vesicles revealing that they are invaginations of the ER membrane, connected to the cytosol through a pore that may regulate import of factors required for RNA replication as well as export of newly synthesized genomes to be used for translation or virus assembly. Additionally, and thanks to the powerful ET technique, the authors demonstrated the presence of virus budding sites in close proximity to the pores of replication vesicles, providing for the first time a direct visualization, in 3D, of this process (Welsch et al., 2009 ).

Title: Why do many pheasants released in the UK die, and how can we best reduce their natural mortality? 
Summary: Therefore, reared pheasants only really contribute to the harvest in the year that they were released, suggesting that the majority of reared pheasants released in the UK are dead within 15 months of release. If such practices are implemented, then we believe that the natural mortality of released pheasants will be reduced and, thus, the number of pheasants released each year into the UK could also be reduced, bringing economic, environmental and ethical benefits to the shooting industry and a broader set of stakeholders.

Summary: In addition to acting as the main barrier between the cells and their external environment, the plasma membrane controls and co-ordinates the internalization of particles and fluids through different endocytic uptake mechanisms (reviewed in Doherty and McMahon, 2009) ; not surprisingly, viruses have learned to subjugate most of these for their own entry (Mercer et al., 2010b) . In addition to modifying the lipid content of existing membranes to co-ordinate virus budding, viruses can promote the active synthesis of lipids to provide membranes for the viral envelope.

Reductions in protein synthesis were similar but not as strong as those observed in cells infected with human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14), included as a positive control in these experiments, and were not observed in cells inoculated with eHAV in the presence of neutralizing anti-HAV antibody which abrogated the ability of eHAV to induce endosomal escape of the ribotoxins ( Figure 4D, Figure 4-figure supplement 1B) .

Title: Citrus tristeza virus: evolution of complex and varied genotypic groups 
Summary: Identification of new genotypes is complicated by asymmetry between the 5 and 3 halves of the genome, for most of the divergence between the groups is most apparent in the 5 end of the genome and the ORF1a/1b genes (Hilf et al., 1999; Albiach-Marti et al., 2000) which contain the replication associated proteins. Silencing itself can affect the evolution of viral genomes in two ways, by selecting for "escape" mutations that alter the target sequence and prevent recognition and degradation (Leonard et al., 2008) , or by selecting for nucleotide compositional changes in the viral genome to match host mRNAs (Dunoyer and Voinnet, 2005) ; the latter has been observed in CTV (Cheng et al., 2012) and may be a significant genetic barrier to the divergence of CTV strains, and also a potential explanation for the absence of intermediate sequences between the major lineages, as an isolate cannot occupy all possible permutations of sequence space (Roossinck and Schneider, 2006; Domingo et al., 2012) .

Title: Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors - friend or foe? 
Summary: As some of the vectors in use will have been seen by the host immune system prior to vaccination, whether the presence of pre-existing immune responses is detrimental for the further development of a vector-based vaccine scheme, or can augment responses to the vectored antigen, needs to be considered in detail. Some studies concluded that pre-existing immunity against the Salmonella vector leads to stronger immune responses against the delivered antigen (Bao & Clements, 1991; Jespersgaard et al., 2001; Kohler et al., 2000a, b; Metzger et al., 2004; Saxena et al., 2009; Sevil Domènech et al., 2008; Whittle & Verma, 1997) , with others considering pre-existing immunity to be a limiting factor in the long-term use of Salmonella as an efficient vector for antigen delivery (Attridge et al., 1997; Gahan et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 1999; Sevil Domènech et al., 2007; Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003a, b) .

Summary: In addition, we found an association of the IRF4 AATC and IRF4 GGTC haplotypes (not including the IRF4 rs12203592T risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA but the magnitude of the association was similar to the one observed in the single-SNP analysis, which indicated that the haplotypic effect on IA risk was likely due to the IRF4 rs12203592 SNP. However, despite the potential interest of these results and the evidences supporting a functional role of the IRF4 rs12203592 variant in regulating IRF4 mRNA expression and thereby modulating the NFκB pathway (Boddicker et al., 2015) and IRF4-dependent immune responses (Schlitzer et al., 2013; Bajaña et al., 2016) , the association of this variant did not remain significant at the experiment-wide significance threshold, suggesting that the association of this polymorphism with IA could be due to chance.

Summary: Sources of uncertainty may be related to: (1) the type of presence only data used limits the number of analytical methods that can be used and hampers the identification of limiting factors; (2) the effects of climate on HeV spillover act at several different levels of ecological organisation and are not well understood, for instance temperature, humidity and ground vegetation might also limit the available pathways for HeV transmission to horses (Martin et al. Therefore, the models represent the underlying risk to any spillover hosts present in the areas predicted to be at risk due to the presence of the reservoir host and the effects of climate on the HeV spillover system.

Title: Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence 
Summary: In order to compare the relative contributions of each cell line's disparate immune processes to epidemic dynamics, we next used our mean field parameter estimates to calculate the initial 'antiviral rate'-the initial accumulation rate of antiviral cells upon virus invasion for each cell-virus-MOI combination-based on the following equation: where P E was calculated from the initial infectious dose (MOI) of each infection experiment and P S was estimated at disease-free equilibrium: Because and " both contribute to this initial antiviral rate, induced and constitutive immune assumptions are capable of yielding equally rapid rates, depending on parameter fits. Specifically, we carried out multiple time series of infection of each cell line with each of the viruses described above, under mock infection conditions and at MOIs of 0.0001 and 0.001-with the exception of rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cell lines, for which infection was only performed at MOI = 0.0001 due to limited viral stocks and the extremely low infectivity of this virus on this cell line (thus requiring high viral loads for initial infection).

Title: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Dromedaries in Ethiopia Is Antigenically Different From the Middle East Isolate EMC 
Summary: To evaluate the roles of these proteins in the Amibara isolates, recombinant MERS-CoVs were generated using a BAC vector system (Terada et al., 2017; Matsuyama et al., 2018) in which the S protein sequence of the EMC isolate was replaced with those of the Amibara isolates and designated as 118S and 126S ( Figure 3A ). By contrast, TMPRSS2 was shown to enhance viral entry and replication of MERS-CoV (Gierer et al., 2013; Shirato et al., 2013) , although the peak titers of the recombinants in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells were similar, with a slight delay in replication in the Amibara S recombinants at 1-day post-infection ( Figure 3C ).

Title: Translational Studies of Alcoholism Bridging the Gap 
Summary: A DSM-IV Criteria for Alcohol Dependence 1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a) need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect b) markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol 2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a) characteristic withdrawal (e.g., insomnia, psychomotor agitations, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting) b) alcohol is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms 3) Alcohol often is taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended 4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control alcohol use/reduce use (i.e., inability to control use) 5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects 6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use 7) Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacer bated by alcohol (e.g., continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) 1) The animal should orally self-administer alcohol 2) The amount of alcohol consumed should result in pharmacologically relevant blood alcohol levels 3) Alcohol should be consumed for its postingestive pharmacological effects and not strictly for its caloric value or taste 4) Alcohol should be positively reinforcing, or in other words, the animals must be willing to work for alcohol 5) Chronic alcohol consumption should lead to the expression of metabolic and functional tolerance 6) Chronic consumption of alcohol should lead to depen dence, as indicated by withdrawal symptoms after access to alcohol is terminated 7) The animal should display characteristics associated with relapse  Neurobiological theories of alcoholism offer a framework from which to develop, design, and test hypothesis-driven experiments in human alcoholics and animal models of alcoholism. This increase in neurogenesis during abstinence from chronic alcohol exposure may be related to the recovery of brain volume deficits (Pfefferbaum et al.

Title: Effectiveness of traveller screening for emerging pathogens is shaped by epidemiology and natural history of infection 
Summary: As the effectiveness of integrated screening programs will depend both on the pathogen-specific natural history of infection and epidemiological knowledge of exposure risk, as well as travel time and efficacy of screening methods, it is important to understand how these different factors contribute to screening effectiveness at departure and arrival. Empirical evidence suggests that the majority of travellers with known exposure would not selfreport (Hale et al., 2012; Gunaratnam et al., 2014) , so the absolute effectiveness of risk factor screening in our model was lower than the effectiveness of symptom screening once cases progressed to onset, even if many exposed travellers were not yet symptomatic and symptom screening was only 70% effective (Bitar et al., 2009) .

Title: Primate Infectious Disease Ecology: Insights and Future Directions at the Human-Macaque Interface 
Summary: Conversely, the idea that group-living and social structure may also impact the diversity and prevalence of parasites in hosts (Drewe and Perkins 2015; VanderWaal and Ezenwa 2016) has led to such socioecological approaches to also focus on the identification of potential "super spreaders" or "social bottlenecks" of infection (Balasubramaniam et al. Such variation in human-and macaque-specific features across interfaces generates a broad variety of direct and indirect interactions, such as (1) human provisioning of macaques, (2) macaques using anthropogenic landscape features (e.g., buildings, fences, water tanks), (3) mutual contact-and non-contact aggression, (4) the exchange of body fluids like blood and saliva, (5) the fragmentation of macaque populations on account of the loss of natural habitat, (6) the hunting and consumption of macaques by humans as bush-meat, and (7) the use of macaques as pets, trade commodities, or tourist attractions Gumert et al.

Title: Unfolded protein response in hepatitis C virus infection 
Summary: Nevertheless, there is overwhelming evidence from in vivo and in vitro experiments to suggest that the ER stress response plays an important role in the life cycle of HCV (Liberman et al., 1999; Tardif et al., 2002 Tardif et al., , 2004 Benali-Furet et al., 2005; Egan, 2005, 2009; Ciccaglione et al., 2005 Ciccaglione et al., , 2007 Zheng et al., 2005; Tumurbaatar et al., 2007; Sekine-Osajima et al., 2008; Joyce et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Mishima et al., 2010; Von Dem Bussche et al., 2010; Funaoka et al., 2011; Merquiol et al., 2011; Shinohara et al., 2013) . Despite overwhelming evidence from in vivo (transgenic and humanized mice) and in vitro studies to indicate that HCV infection causes ER stress and induces the UPR, we still need to confirm the presence of ER stress in hepatitis C patients by conducting clinical studies at single cells level (Liberman et al., 1999; Tardif et al., 2002 Tardif et al., , 2004 Benali-Furet et al., 2005; Egan, 2005, 2009; Ciccaglione et al., 2005 Ciccaglione et al., , 2007 Zheng et al., 2005; Tumurbaatar et al., 2007; Sekine-Osajima et al., 2008; Joyce et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Mishima et al., 2010; Von Dem Bussche et al., 2010; Funaoka et al., 2011; Merquiol et al., 2011; Shinohara et al., 2013) .

Title: Complement Evasion Strategies of Viruses: An Overview 
Summary: The elimination of viruses by the complement system is owing to direct neutralization of cellfree viruses , lysis of the virus-infected cells (Cooper and Nemerow, 1983) , induction of antiviral state (Tam et al., 2014) , and boosting of virus-specific immune responses due to recognition of effector fragments of complement along with viral antigens by the immune cells (Pyaram et al., 2010b; Kolev et al., 2014; Rattan et al., 2017) . The AP, which is activated spontaneously, is capable of neutralizing viruses directly as well as owing to its activation by the CP and LP [i.e., due to activation of the AP loop by CP and LP (Moulton et al., 2008; Rattan et al., 2017)] .

Title: Are Microglial Cells the Regulators of Lymphocyte Responses in the CNS? 
Summary: In this regard, several lines of evidence, including in vitro studies (Fischer and Reichmann, 2001; Butovsky et al., 2007) and neuroinflammatory situations such as ischemia (Kostulas et al., 2002) and EAE (Fischer and Reichmann, 2001; Almolda et al., 2011b; Wlodarczyk et al., 2014) , support the hypothesis that parenchymal DCs are derived from the differentiation of local cells, probably microglia, on the basis that the expression of some of the surface antigens commonly used for the identification of DCs, such as CD11c, MHCII and CD86, are found in activated microglial cells. Even more, an interesting study (Anandasabapathy et al., 2011) using the Flt3-treatment, a transcription factor involved in the generation of DCs (Waskow et al., 2008; Kingston et al., 2009) , to induce the expansion of DCs in transgenic mice carrying the EYFP fluorescent protein under the control of the CD11c promoter, demonstrated the presence of two different populations of CD11c+ cells within healthy CNS.

Title: Non-canonical translation in RNA viruses 
Summary: In those picornaviruses harbouring type I IRESes (poliovirus and other enteroviruses), the initiator AUG for translation of the viral polyprotein is located some distance downstream of the site of recruitment of the 40S subunit to the IRES, and some form of scanning is required to locate it. In murine norovirus (family Caliciviridae), translation of an ORF overlapping the capsid coding sequence appears to initiate at the third AUG codon on the sgRNA (underlined in gugaAUGaggAUGagugAUGg; McFadden et al., 2011) despite the presence of two upstream AUG codons, the second of which is in a good context with an A at 23.

HRV does, however, differ from EVs in showing lower divergence thresholds for type assignments (12-13 % nucleotide sequence divergence in VP1) and a lack of capsid recombination that enables VP4/VP2 sequences to be used at least for type identification.

Several positively selected sites (E638, K642, E649, and N653 in Chiroptera; C639 and R651 in Primates) localize to the short HLE element, which constitutes the binding-pocket for RNA and modulates the preference of the enzyme for single-stranded RNA molecules or stem loops (Korennykh et al.

Title: Ultrastructure and lipid composition of detergent-resistant membranes derived from mammalian sperm and two types of epithelial cells 
Summary: Beyond the study of cholesterol and phospholipids, the partitioning of glycolipids from sperm and MDCK cells into the Triton soluble and insoluble membrane fraction (representing the L d and L o phase) was also compared. In fact, the degree of unsaturation of PE and PC was not different from that of the total cellular lipid fraction, indicating that the sn-2 acyl chains of the most abundant phospholipids classes in mammalian membranes do not discriminate between the DRM and the detergent-soluble fraction of those membranes..

Title: Vesicular stomatitis virus with the rabies virus glycoprotein directs retrograde transsynaptic transport among neurons in vivo 
Summary: Cells labeled by rVSV G(RABV-G) were observed in the CP, GP, substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, and layers 3 and 5 of the cortex, consistent with infection at the axon terminal and retrograde labeling of cell bodies of neurons known to project directly to the CP ( Figure 5C ) (Albin et al., 1995) . Since native VSV does not have these retrograde transsynaptic properties (van den Pol et al., 2002; Beier et al., 2011) , and the only alteration to the VSV genome was the substitution of the VSV G gene with the G gene of RABV, it is clear that the RABV glycoprotein is responsible for retrograde direction of viral transmission across synapses, at least in the case of rVSV.

Title: Slicing and dicing viruses: antiviral RNA interference in mammals 
Summary: First, viral infections in these organisms lead to the accumulation of Dicer-dependent virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs) that originate from dsRNA viral replication intermediates and/or RNA hairpins and are homologous to viral RNA sequences (Yoo et al, 2004; Molnar et al, 2005; Galiana-Arnoux et al, 2006; Ho et al, 2006; van Rij et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2006a; Aliyari et al, 2008; Félix et al, 2011) . The sequence-specific silencing induced by long dsRNA in oocytes and ESCs/ECs correlated with a relative inability of these cells to produce and/or respond to IFN (Burke et al, 1978; Francis & Lehman, 1989; Stein et al, 2005; D'Angelo et al, 2016; Wu et al, 2018) , which suggested that dsRNAi might be active in mammalian undifferentiated cells but masked or inhibited by the IFN system in differentiated cells.

Title: REVIEW Current progress in innovative engineered antibodies 
Summary: There are five fundamental groups of bispecific antibody formats: (i) asymmetric bivalent, bispecific IgG-like antibodies with heterodimeric heavy chains (HCs) (Ridgeway et al., 1996; Merchant et al., 1998; Gunasekaran et al., 2010; Strop et al., 2012; Klein et al., 2012; Labrijn et al., 2013 Von Kreudenstein et al., 2013 Brinkmann and Kontermann, 2017) ; (ii) tetravalent multispecific antibodies that are comprised of IgGs, with additional binding domains, e.g., scFvs, Fvs, VHH domains, or non-antibody binding scaffolds such as fynomers (Brack et al., 2014; Silacci et al., 2016) , fused to either the N-or C-termini of either the heavy or light chains (LCs) (Coloma and Morrison, 1997) ; (iii) engineered binding domains within the normal IgG structure, such as the "two-in-one" bispecific approach from Genentech (Bostrom et al., 2009; Eigenbrot and Fuh, 2013) and the F-STAR approach of designing novel second binding sites within the C H 3 domain , (iv) engineered antibody fragments linked by short peptide linkers which can be made into bivalent, trivalent, or tetravalent formats addressing two to three targets (Mack et al., 1995; Holliger and Winter, 1997; Kipriyanov et al., 1999; Reusch et al., 2015; Egan et al., 2016) . Additionally, both the size of the cell surface receptor of the target cells and the epitope to which the antibody binds appear to be critical factors in potency as well (Bluemel et al., 2010) .

Title: Accounting for Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in the Computation of Codon Usage Bias Indices 
Summary: Figure 4 shows that correcting for the presence of -1 PRF signals with a -1 PRF efficiency of up to p ¼ 0:3 does not substantially affect the CUB index to protein expression relationship for both CUB index corrections, if the extra cost of mRNA degradation by NMD is neglected (p ¼ 0). In particular, the sensitivity ofÎ c to -1 PRF efficiency is mediated by the value of p. Figure 5A shows that the correlations between bothÎ c and I a to protein expression levels decline for increasing values of p and different values of p. As p increases, and for low costs of NMD-mediated mRNA decay, the correlation ofÎ c to protein expression levels declines to very low values ( 0:2 at p ¼ 0:9 for p ¼ 0; 10; 100).

Title: Functional analysis of potential cleavage sites in the MERS- coronavirus spike protein 
Summary: Finally, our results suggest that the second arginine at the S2′ site might be essential for MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, since mutation of this residue markedly reduced S protein-driven entry into Caco-2 cells, while mutation of the first arginine did not diminish entry efficiency Efficient MERS-S-driven entry into Vero E6, 293T and 293T+DPP4 cells was facilitated by cathepsin L and was largely independent of the S1/S2 site but required an intact S2′ site, in keeping with cleavage of this site being required for liberation of the N-terminus of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit. Cathepsin L activity is required for Vero E6 cell entry driven by a mutant S protein that lacks the S1/ S2 and the S2′ sites.

It has been reported that the prM proteins of Dengue viruses 1-3 but not those of Dengue 4 or West Nile virus, interact with the cellular transmembrane KDEL receptor (KDELR) proteins 1 and 2 and that this interaction is required for transferring the virions from the ER to the Golgi [84] .

Title: viruses The Role of Phlebovirus Glycoproteins in Viral Entry, Assembly and Release 
Summary: Expression of vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) promotes UUKV penetration, while interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 2 and IFITM3 inhibit the fusion of RVFV in late endosomes; (C) The fusion of viral and endosomal membranes allows release of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes into the cytoplasm, the site of viral transcription and replication; (D) The viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, which is cleaved by signal peptidase. In the case of UUKV, the sequence required for Golgi retention is entirely located in the cytoplasmic tail of Gn [115, 121] while for RVFV and PTV the Golgi retention signal consists of the Gn transmembrane domain and the adjacent amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail [122, 124, 127] .

Title: Interferon-inducible ribonuclease ISG20 inhibits hepatitis B virus replication through directly binding to the epsilon stem-loop structure of viral RNA Author summary 
Summary: We report herein that: 1) the endogenous ISG20 is a restriction factor for HBV replication and it can be upregulated by all three types of IFN to further inhibit HBV; 2) ISG20 inhibits HBV replication primarily by promoting viral RNA degradation; 3) ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation depends on its ribonuclease activity, but the enzymatically inactivated form retains antiviral activity against pgRNA encapsidation by competing with HBV pol for pgRNA binding; 4) ISG20 recognizes HBV RNA through directly binding to the lower stem region of epsilon and the binding domain on ISG20 is located in Exo III motif; 5) ISG20-epsilon binding is essential to ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation in cell cultures, and other cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade the stem-loop region of HBV RNA. Nonetheless, in the cells treated with IFN-α and ISG20 siRNA, the levels of HBV RNA were restored to the untreated control level (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1-3), suggesting that ISG20 plays a major role in IFN-mediated reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells.

However, because IGF-1R is not the sole protein interacting with LecB in keratinocytes, we speculate that this "targeting for degradation" strategy can be valid for other plasma membrane receptors as well (e.g., EGFR) and that it can be used by P. aeruginosa to silence host cell receptors to favour tissue colonisation in wounds.

Title: A Single Polar Residue and Distinct Membrane Topologies Impact the Function of the Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus E Protein 
Summary: Taken together these data indicate that the effect of SARS-CoV E, MHV E, and TGEV E on the host secretory pathway may be different than that of IBV E, and potentially point to an important difference in the function of the proteins. Since we found that a transmembrane topology and T16 are required for disrupting the secretory pathway, and both are predicted to be important for ion channel activity, it is certainly possible that the disruption of the secretory pathway is due to the putative channel activity of IBV E. Alteration of Golgi complex structure and disruption of protein traffic occur when the ion balance at the Golgi complex is disrupted [26] [27] [28] [29] .

Title: Building Cell Selectivity into CPP-Mediated Strategies 
Summary: The authors have been cautious in the interpretation of their results and have not directly related the presence of a complementary PNA for a highly expressed protein in the cells with the longer retention time of the particles inside the cells. There are several examples of drug delivery systems in which CPPs are used to increase the penetrability of the system into cells.

Title: A census of α-helical membrane proteins in double-stranded DNA viruses infecting bacteria and archaea 
Summary: To further assess the accuracy of the TM topology assignments and verify that the small number of TM segments in virus proteins is not a consequence of the small characteristic size of viral proteins, we analyzed the dependence of TM predictions on protein length. Finally, viral membrane proteomes consist predominantly of proteins with a single TM, in contrast to the membrane proteomes of bacteria and archaea that are rich in TM proteins with multiple TM segments, in particular 6-TM and 12-TM proteins.

Title: Article 1139 1 Original research 
Summary: Taken together, the herein described data set uncovers several novel insights into the dynamics and the type specificity of the proteome alterations induced by IFNs, constituting an ideal starting point for mechanistic studies, e.g., into the exact signaling pathways leading to the repression of IRepGs and their biological relevance in defense against pathogens and tumors. In addition, our finding that the differential responses (e.g., gene repression of IRepGs stimulated by IFNγ but not by IFNα) were observed on different levels (protein and mRNA), in different species (mouse and human) and in different cell types (macrophages and fibroblasts) suggest that the herein described differences are rather common.

Title: Developing Universal Influenza Vaccines: Hitting the Nail, Not Just on the Head 
Summary: However, comparison of the sequences of PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and M1 proteins showed that 55 sequences of 9-58 amino acids were completely conserved in at least 80%, or even as much as 95% to 100%, of the avian and human influenza A virus isolates and, although HA is generally considered to be highly variable, there was one 9 amino acid sequence that was conserved in all type A viruses [37] . Based on the knowledge that stem-specific antibodies broadly neutralizing group 1 and 2 HA molecules exist in humans, it has been postulated that the design of a universal vaccine that induces a combination of broadly neutralizing stem-specific antibodies is possible and would effectively protect against infection with all influenza A viruses [56] .

Title: viruses Roles of the Picornaviral 3C Proteinase in the Viral Life Cycle and Host Cells 
Summary: Except for their crucial role in the replication of picornaviruses and inhibition of protein synthesis in host cells, the 3C pro s of PV and FMDV have been previously reported to mediate cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 4(MAP-4) and cause disruption of the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) [87, 88] . Due to their proteinase activities, 3C pro and its precursor 3CD are involved in the processing of the polyprotein, but their catalytic efficiencies and specificities exhibit differences that are related to the different substrate-binding site residues in the 3C domain and the N-terminus of 3C pro .

Title: Clinical Medicine Innate Immune Responses and Viral-Induced Neurologic Disease 
Summary: Further evidence for a role for neutrophils in augmenting demyelination is provided by Segal and colleagues [93] who demonstrated that Cxcr2-/mice are relatively resistant to EAE and this correlated with reduced infiltration of neutrophils into CNS; however, transfer of CXCR2+ neutrophils into Cxcr2-/mice immunized with encephalitogenic myelin peptides resulted in increased clinical disease and demyelination supporting the notion that neutrophils contribute to disease in EAE. Although neutrophils have been shown to contribute to clinical disease and white matter damage in EAE as well as toxin models of demyelination [86] [87] [88] 93, 94] , the function of these cells in models of viral-induced demyelination have not been as well-characterized.

Because H5N1 virus, poly (I:C), LPS and LTA can all induce the expression of miR-200c-3p to downregulate ACE2 protein expression, we speculate that the expression of miR-200c-3p may be aberrant in severe pneumonia infection.

Title: Induction of Apoptosis by the Nonstructural Protein 4 and 10 of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 
Summary: To screen the viral apoptosis inducers in PRRSV, the cleavage of PARP in MARC-145 cells that were expressing individual Nsp of PRRSV was investigated by Western blot, and IFA was performed to determine the active form of caspase-3 in the cells that were expressing individual PRRSV Nsp using anti-caspase-3 p17 antibody interacting specifically with the cleaved caspase-3 ( Fig 5) . The Nsp4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV are shown to be apoptosis inducers, and Nsp4 induces apoptosis through manipulations on the pro-or anti-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 family members, and both activation of caspase-8 and Bid are required for Nsp10-induced apoptosis, suggesting the establishment of a crosstalk between extrinsic-and intrinsic-apoptotic pathways.

Summary: This efficient recruitment is also in agreement with the strong enrichment of ARTD1 in the TARG1 interactome in the absence of olaparib (Fig. Thus, RNA binding occurs probably in the vicinity of the ADPr binding pocket of TARG1 and the efficient competition by PAR requires interaction in this pocket and at surface sites that also interact with RNA.

Title: The Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Is a Multifunctional Protein 
Summary: In addition, the CTD 45 residues of the MHV N protein have been shown to be the major determinant for interaction with the M protein [61] , and so association of the N protein with the M protein may also play a role in the assembly of the nucleocapsid core into a progeny virion [47] . The M protein is the main core shell component and a 16 amino acid domain (aa 237-252) on the CTD of M protein binds directly to N protein via an ionic interaction, leading to specific genome encapsidation in the budding viral particle [81] [82] [83] .The N protein therefore plays an essential structural role in the CoV virion through a network of interactions with (i) the genomic RNA; (ii) M protein and (iii) other N proteins.

Title: Zika (PRVABC59) Infection Is Associated with T cell Infiltration and Neurodegeneration in CNS of Immunocompetent Neonatal C57Bl/6 Mice 
Summary: In contrast, the CNS of B6WT mice showed virus predominantly in the cerebellar white matter and granular layers as well as in the hippocampus region (  We next determined whether the immune response to the virus in the CNS was similar between IFNAR KO and B6 WT mice. Lastly, given the limited neurodegeneration observed in the CNS of IFNAR KO mice at peak of disease and the rapidity of death in the IFNAR KO mice, it is possible that infection of the peripheral organs contribute to the lethality of ZIKV infection in IFNAR KO mice, and thus although the mice show clear signs of neurological damage, additional studies will be needed to establish the cause of death in the infected IFNAR KO mice.

Title: Advances in Non-Viral DNA Vectors for Gene Therapy 
Summary: The use of antibiotics and their resistance genes in the preparation of plasmid vectors, however, is discouraged by regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency because of the risk of transfer and replication of resistance genes to bacteria in the human microbiome and possibly into the environment.

Title: Recent Progress in Studies of Arterivirus-and Coronavirus-Host Interactions 
Summary: SARS-CoV, on the other hand, has been shown to attenuate the IRE1 signaling pathway, which generally led to the down-regulation of stress responses and UPR, and further decreased apoptotic signaling in infected cells as well, to the likely benefit of the virus for better viral progeny production and release [129] . While much progress has been made in the elucidation of the various regulatory pathways that, under the most propitious of conditions, will allow virus and host to co-exist in an uneasy truce, a clearer understanding of the complex interplay between the virus and its host could give new insights into the role of main players, such as those that govern the onset of apoptosis, or type I interferons and their regulators, and lead to the discovery of novel and/or universal targets for the therapeutic mediation against pathogenic infection.

Title: Tick-borne encephalitis virus inhibits rRNA synthesis and host protein production in human cells of neural origin 
Summary: We quantified the levels of 18S and 28S rRNAs in total cellular RNA from TBEV-infected DAOY cells at 24 and 48 hours p.i. We propose alternative ways by which TBEV could interfere with transcription and/or translation in DAOY cells: 1) TBEV negatively affects the translation of host proteins, including POLR1, transcription factors, and ribosomal proteins; their lower levels subsequently result in a decline in synthesis of all rRNA species; or 2) TBEV directly interferes with de novo synthesis of 45-47S pre-rRNA (but not 5S rRNA) via a POLR1 specific mechanism, which reduces the levels of 18S and 28S rRNAs and this leads to the decline of translational rate in host cells; 3) transcription and translation can be modified independently by both viral or cellular factors as a result of infection (summarised in Fig 8) .

Treatment of CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor bearing mice with AAV8-h1567 and human PBMCs resulted in a marked increase in the number of tumorinfiltrating human CD56 + NK cells, suggesting that CD16A which is expressed on human NK cells is involved in this tumor cell killing through it's interaction with the Fc portion of h1567, a finding that has been experimentally confirmed through Fc mutagenesis studies (data not shown).

Strikingly, we found that genes that were expressed at significantly greater levels in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts were substantially and significantly The EBV/HRS/IL-4 signature was defined as the 92 genes that were identified as common to the 2084 genes up-regulated in EBV-transformed LCLs established from GC-B cells [37] , the 1747 genes up-regulated in HRS [38] , and the 484 genes down-regulated by IL4 in T cells [35] .

Summary: Although early studies suggested a translational block may account for the loss of host protein production during IAV infection, more recent studies have focused on three main mechanisms of host shutoff by IAV infection: a block in cellular mRNA processing and nuclear export, degradation of host RNA Pol II, and widespread host mRNA degradation. In contrast to the mRNAs of DNA viruses like herpesviruses, the biogenesis of IAV mRNAs is very different from that of host mRNAs and requires virus-encoded machinery.

Title: Role of the Spike Glycoprotein of Human Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Virus Entry and Syncytia Formation 
Summary: In addition to entry by endocytosis, we showed that, like SARS-CoV [21, 22] , MERS pseudovirions could enter susceptible Vero E6 cells at the plasma membrane if virions were first bound to cell surface receptors at 4°C at neutral pH in the presence of NH 4 Cl to inhibit acidification of endosomes, and also treated briefly at room temperature with trypsin to cleave the viral S protein. In summary, we demonstrated that, similar to SARS-CoV, cleavage of MERS-CoV-S protein by trypsin, TMPRSS2 or -4 or cathepsin L is required to activate the membrane fusion activity of S, leading to virus entry and syncytia formation, and that the location of the protease determines whether virus enters via endocytosis or by fusion at the plasma membrane.

Title: Cell-Penetrating Peptides for Antiviral Drug Development 
Summary: Their antimicrobial activity has been reported against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, blocking viral infection in different ways [110] : they can directly inactivate the virion through disruption of its envelop or interaction with its glycoproteins; they can act on infected cells possibly through interactions with cell receptors resulting in alterations in cellsignaling pathways required for virus replication; they can block the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome of the host cell, thereby interfering with viral replication; finally, they can interact with and inhibit viral enzymes essential to the virus replication [111] . Of all the CPP-antiviral investigations, PPMO studies are the ones that are at the most advanced stage, with several reports of use in animal models and directed against a wide range of viruses.

Summary: The response of CC013 mice to TMEV was also distinct from those of previously studied inbred strains: 3 CC013 mice (out of 18 total) died during one phase or the other of TMEV infection, and based on the ongoing signs of encephalitis, these mice experienced a persistent state of inflammation rather than the typical immune shifts seen in TMEV infection 58, 59 . To identify phenotypic differences related to the acute phase of TMEV infection, roughly half of the Group B mice (2 females and 2 males per strain, including 1 infected of each sex) were evaluated for 7 dpi and the remaining mice (2-3 mice of each sex per strain, including 1-2 infected per sex) for 28 dpi.

Title: Local Antigen Encounter Is Essential for Establishing Persistent CD8 + T-Cell Memory in the CNS 
Summary: However, when analyzing the specificity of the recruited cells (Figure 2B) , we found that only in the presence of the relevant (GP 33−41 ) epitope locally and not merely as a result of adeno-vector induced bystander inflammation, were GP 33 specific CD8 + T cells recruited to the brain. In conclusion, we have shown that local antigen encounter is critical for establishment, but not maintenance of an antigen specific CD8 + T-cell memory population in the CNS, whereas inflammation in the absence of cognate antigen is only associated with limited and transient CD8 + T-cell infiltration.

In this regard, clinical evidence of the potential effectiveness of immune-modulatory strategies designed to strengthen HBV-specific T-cell responses by adoptive transfer of engineered antigen-specific T lymphocytes are based on the observation that virus-specific T cell administration through a bone marrow transplant from subjects who cleared HBV infection spontaneously, to patients with chronic HBV infection, led to virus control [108] .

Title: The differentiated airway epithelium infected by influenza viruses maintains the barrier function despite a dramatic loss of ciliated cells OPEN 
Summary: The infection by IAV was detrimental for the airway epithelial cells as indicated by the detection of apoptotic cells. On the other side, the loss of well-differentiated cells is compensated by the generation of polarized cells that maintain the barrier function of the epithelial cell layer which may contribute to the restriction of the infection to the respiratory tract.

Title: A mobile loop near the active site acts as a switch between the dual activities of a viral protease/deubiquitinase 
Summary: In contrast, mutants in the hydrophobic zipper (P866G/P867G), and the mutant introducing a charge in the distant patch (I847D), which were the most severely defective in the in vitro DUB assay (less than 5%, see Table 2 ), both displayed a drastic decrease in their DUB activity in vivo, as shown by the high accumulation of 66K-Ub conjugates in transfected cells (lanes 6 and 10). Altogether, upon assessment of the infectivity of viral mutants in whole plants, we thus conclude that two superimposed phenomena most likely contribute to the observed variations in viral RNA accumulation and appearance of symptoms: 1) the conformation of the GPP flap, whose opening/closure may impact the severity of symptoms, culminating in the appearance of local necrotic lesions restricting viral infection in the case of the P866G/P867G mutant, 2) the level of DUB activity, which contributes to the extent of viral RNA accumulation very similarly in protoplasts and in planta, thus confirming the importance of this enzymatic activity for viral infectivity.

To test whether 2BC, 3A, or both were sufficient to induce colocalization of GFP-LC3 and LAMP1 as observed in poliovirus-infected cells, proteins 2BC and 3A were expressed singly or in combination in 293T cells in the presence of GFP-LC3.

Title: Single amino acid substitution (G42E) in the receptor binding domain of mouse mammary tumour virus envelope protein facilitates infection of non-murine cells in a transferrin receptor 1-independent manner 
Summary: Persistently infected Hs578T cells produced infectious virus particles capable of infecting naive human breast cells in culture, the infectivity of which could be blocked by neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies, heatinactivation and AZT, demonstrating that virus particles released by the persistently infected Hs578T cells are antigenically related to the virus produced from murine cells and showing that the presence of proviral DNA in infected cells is due to an authentic, receptor-mediated and reverse transcriptase-dependent infection process [31] . The replication of MMTV(C3H) in human cells led to the adaptation of the virus to its new host by shaping the receptor binding domain to optimize the interaction with its receptor(s).

Title: HIV-1 Fusion Is Blocked through Binding of GB Virus C E2D Peptides to the HIV-1 gp41 Disulfide Loop 
Summary: In combination with these findings, we are able to show that the N-terminal region of GBV-C E2 (,residue 37 to 64), that is represented by the HIV-1-inhibitory peptides P4-7 and P6-2, interacts with HIV-1 gp41 and that the cysteine residues within this region appear to contribute substantially to the gp41 binding. However, it is very plausible that other E2 regions interact with the N-terminal gp41 fusion peptide, in addition to the interaction of the GBV-C E2 N-terminus with the gp41 disulfide loop proposed in this study.

Title: Incorporation of Spike and Membrane Glycoproteins into Coronavirus Virions 
Summary: The M proteins of most CoVs accumulate at the ERGIC and predominantly the Golgi complex, and are not detected at the plasma membrane of infected cells or single M-expressing cells [40, [72] [73] [74] [75] , indicating that most CoV-M proteins contain an intrinsic retention signal that leads to their accumulation in the Golgi complex in the absence of the other viral proteins. Although the KxHxx motif of SCoV-S showed a reduced rate of trafficking through the Golgi complex and partially retained exogenous proteins in the ERGIC, both the wt SCoV-S and a mutant S protein lacking the KxHxx motif were detected on the cell surface to the same extent, suggesting that the motif of SCoV-S is less potent than that of PEDV-S [110] .

Summary: In this line, and contrary to above mentioned report [73] , CQ, an FDA-approved anti-inflammatory 4-aminoquinoline and an autophagy inhibitor widely used as an anti-malaria drug that is administered to pregnant women at risk of exposure to Plasmodium parasites, was shown to have anti-ZIKV activity in different cell types (Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), and human neural stem cells (NSCs)), affecting early stages of the viral life cycle, possibly by raising the endosomal pH and inhibiting the fusion of the envelope protein to the endosomal membrane [74, 75] . Among them are antiparasitics such as ivermectin (used mainly against worms infections) and pyrimethamine (a folic acid antagonist that inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase and, thus, DNA and RNA synthesis, is classified as a pregnancy category C, and was initially used to treat malaria and now toxoplasmosis and cystoisosporiasis) [70] ; antibiotics such as azithromycin that prevents infection, replication, and virus-mediated cell dead [55] , and kitasamycin (a natural product from Streptomyces narbonensis that inhibits protein biosynthesis) [107] ; drugs used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as palonosetron (a FDA-approved 5-HT3 antagonist) [107] ; antidepressants like sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) [107] and cyclosporine (that is also use for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants, is believed to lower the activity of T-cells, and is currently in clinical trials for tis possible use in ameliorate neuronal cellular damage) [70] .

Title: Article 517 Q (2019) Fish Autophagy Protein 5 Exerts Negative Regulation on Antiviral Immune Response Against Iridovirus and Nodavirus 
Summary: To clarify the effects of EcAtg5 overexpression on virus infection, EcAtg5 transfected cells were infected with SGIV or RGNNV, and then viral replication was investigated. The altered expression level of EcAtg5 in GS cells infected with SGIV and RGNNV suggested that EcAtg5 might play an essential role in the grouper response to fish virus infection, so the impact of EcAtg5 overexpression on virus proliferation were investigated.

Title: viruses Who Regulates Whom? An Overview of RNA Granules and Viral Infections 
Summary: In addition, given that DDX3 has been implicated in the sensing of viral RNA to modulate IFN production and SG assembly (reviewed in [180] ), Thulasi Raman and colleagues showed that DDX3 interacts with NP and colocalizes in SGs upon infection with an IAV mutant lacking NS1, suggesting a novel antiviral function for DDX3 [192] . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus in the family Rhabdoviridae, induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α and promotes the assembly of SG-like particles that contain TIA-1, TIAR, PCBP2, viral replication proteins and RNA, but not the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), nor eIF4A [195] , suggesting that the SG-like structures may play a role in the VSV infection cycle.

Title: Vaccine Potential of Nipah Virus-Like Particles 
Summary: Since the ratio of the protein expression plasmids used at transfection and the time of harvest may have a bearing on the level of VLP formation, a minigenome-based VLP infectivity assay, similar to those described previously [59, 60] was used to determine the relative concentrations of the constituent plasmids, and to determine the kinetics of VLP formation for optimal production. We could deduce the presence of biologically active G and F proteins on the VLP surface by the fact that they were able to induce the formation of syncytia in 293 cells ( Figure 4 ); this is a process that requires the interaction of both the surface glycoproteins, the attachment protein G, and the fusion competent F protein, when they come in contact with the cognate receptor-bearing cells.

At the end of infection the cells were processed for confocal microscopy using NS2 to detect infected cells.

Title: molecules Developing Novel G-Quadruplex Ligands: From Interaction with Nucleic Acids to Interfering with Nucleic Acid-Protein Interaction 
Summary: According to the different biological functions of G-quadruplexes in different regions, molecules interacting with quadruplexes can influence cells in different ways: (1) suppression of oncogenes' expression by stabilizing DNA G-quadruplexes in the promoters [8,145]; (2) small molecules inhibiting telomerase activity and eliminating the unlimited proliferation of tumor cells by stabilizing G-quadruplexes at the end of chromosomes [146] ; and (3) blocking replication forks and inducing ssDNA gaps or breaks in tumor cells [128, 147] . In the process of replication fork formation, FANCJ promotes the partial unwinding of double-stranded DNA into a single strand, which facilitates the formation of G-quadruplexes and hinders the synthesis of DNA by DNA polymerase [235] .

Title: Lipopolysaccharide and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibit Interferon Signaling in Hepatocytes by Increasing Ubiquitin-Like Protease 18 (USP18) Expression 
Summary: With this in mind, primary murine hepatocytes from USP18 ϩ/ϩ mice were isolated, transfected with USP18 siRNA or control siRNA, and then exposed to IFN-␣ (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-␣ (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. After a washing step, the cells were treated with IFN-␣ for an additional 6 h. Mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR (normalized to expression of the HPRT housekeeping gene) as an index of downstream IFN-␣ effect. In this study we examined the role of various inflammatory stimuli in the induction of USP18 and the downstream establishment inflammatory stimuli, we examined the induction of STAT-1 phosphorylation in Huh7.5 cells with or without USP18 knockdown (A) and the expression of ISG mRNA (Mx1) in primary mouse hepatocytes and the ability of USP18 knockdown to restore ISG induction after LPS and TNF-␣ stimulation (B).

Summary: The patterns of virus transmission and virus distribution within the aphid for each purified virus (non-treated, EDTA-or sodium sulfite-treated) were consistent in five aphids fed on the different virus preparations ( Table 2) . Although many of these proteins have been detected in phloem sap in other plant species [26] and in the gradients of purified virus, the presence of these proteins is probably unrelated to the transmissibility of virions since they were detected in the fractions from healthy tissue.

Title: Deletion of Fibrinogen-like Protein 2 (FGL-2), a Novel CD4 + CD25 + Treg Effector Molecule, Leads to Improved Control of Echinococcus multilocularis Infection in Mice 
Summary: To further explore the role of VF on Tregs and FGL2 secretion, respectively, spleen cells from AE-WT mice and non-infected WT controls were each cultured in the presence of VF (10 μg/mL). Taken our recent data on the course of cytokine expression by the periparasitic immune infiltrate in E. multilocularis infection [4] combined with the results from this study we propose that in E. multilocularis infected mice the following events occur: (a) TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17A are released by the host at early stage of infection; (b) these cytokines, and especially IFN-γ as demonstrated previously [32] but also IL-17A as shown in the present study, contribute to FGL2-secretion by Tregs and other cells; and (c) secreted FGL2 can bind to FcγRIIB receptor, leads to a late-stage immune suppression by down-regulating the maturation of DCs, decreases co-stimulation of effector T cells, suppresses Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and accelerates Th2 immune responses.

Title: Structural Basis for the Ubiquitin-Linkage Specificity and deISGylating Activity of SARS-CoV Papain-Like Protease 
Summary: To test the validity of these initial models proposed in Figure 5 , and to further refine the positioning of ISG15 and K48-Ub 2 on the structure of PLpro, we surveyed the uppermost region of the SUb2 ridge of PLpro for amino acids that potentially interact with ISG15 or K48-Ub 2 . The F70 ridge mutants (F70A and F70S) of SARS-CoV PLpro are unable to prevent the degradation of IkBa, suggesting that the K48-linked deubiquitinating activity of PLpro is required for PLpro's ability to antagonize the NFkB pathway.

Similar to previous findings that infection with wild type PRRSV or vaccination with PRRS MLV vaccines has been shown to decrease the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccines [31] , inoculation with each of the three PRRS viruses in this study resulted in activation of regulatory T cells and likely decreased the ability of the pigs to mount an effective anti-bacterial immune response.

Title: Type I Interferon Signaling Disrupts the Hepatic Urea Cycle and Alters Systemic Metabolism to Suppress T Cell Function In Brief Article Type I Interferon Signaling Disrupts the Hepatic Urea Cycle and Alters Systemic Metabolism to Suppress T Cell Function 
Summary: Together, these experiments demonstrated that the majority of the observed virus-induced metabolic changes in the liver, including amino-acid-related pathways, correlated with the infection status of the mice and were independent of altered food intake ( Figures 1H and 2D ). Together with the reduction of 13 C 5 arginine, the end product of this pathway, these results support the notion that viral infection initiates a break of the hepatic urea cycle as early as 2 days after infection that persists at least until 8 days after infection and alters levels of metabolites in the circulation ( Figure S5D ).

Summary: To determine whether the phosphorylation of MEK/ERK cascade was indispensible for dasatinib-induced AML differentiation, HL60 and NB4 cells were treated with dasatinib in the presence of MEK inhibitor PD98059 and then analyzed for CD11b expression. Western blotting analysis also confirmed that U0126 not only inhibited dasatinib-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (S727), but also abrogated the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701)  The present study demonstrated the capacity of dasatinib to induce leukemic cell differentiation, as evidenced by the enhanced expression of CD11b, G0/G1 phase arrest and the decreased ratio of nuclear to cytoplasm in dasatinib-treated AML cells.

Title: Cellular Proteins Associated with the Interior and Exterior of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Virions 
Summary: For example, 25% (19/76) of the proteins detected in ProK treated virions but not whole virions were from the position correlating to that of the viral G protein in the whole virion sample (Table S1 and Fig. The mean number of spectra associated with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the G protein were unchanged between whole and ProK treated virions, while ProK treatment decreased the number of spectra associated with the extracellular domain of G. In looking at the distribution of the detected peptides in the G protein, ProK treatment completely eliminated peptides associated with the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain while a few were still detected in the more C-terminal portion of the domain, suggesting this region has a slight degree of resistance to proteinase cleavage, although the decrease in spectral counts suggests the majority the G proteins were cleaved.

Title: Retargeting of Viruses to Generate Oncolytic Agents 
Summary: Finally, the binding of adapter proteins to the virion has, at least in some cases, been reported to ablate the virus' natural tropism, which is especially useful when the oncolytic virus of choice has a preference for normal cells in the host. by viruses genetically redirected through the incorporation of tumor-binding ligands and those having incorporated a bispecific adapter into their viral genome The stability of such recombinant viruses might, however, be a matter of concern, in particular when the targeting protein is required to ablate the natural human tropism.

Title: The ORF2 glycoprotein of hepatitis E virus inhibits cellular NF-κB activity by blocking ubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation of IκBα in human hepatoma cells 
Summary: In human hepatoma cells, ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein βTRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF βTRCP ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the IκBα protein. The NF-κB inhibitory activity of the ORF2 protein may be mediated by its ability to directly associate with the F-box protein βTRCP and inhibit the assembly of the IκBα ubiquitination complex.

Title: Broad-Spectrum Drugs Against Viral Agents 
Summary: In a study evaluating the efficacy of CpG ODN against influenza, mice given 5 μg of a K-type CpG ODN 4 d prior to infection with a lethal dose of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) survived the viral challenge whereas PBS-treated mice did not (Figure 2 ), thus demonstrating that CpG ODN pre-treatment is efficacious against influenza viral infection [103] . The disparate results observed with mice infected with HSV-2 can likely be attributed to the timing of CpG ODN administration with treatment 24 h prior to infection resulting in complete protection and treatment 2-6 h post-infection resulting in partial protection, although the strain of mouse used could also bias the results with BALB/c and Swiss Webster mice being used, respectively.

Summary: Furthermore, the surface of an LNP can be decorated with specific targeting entities which direct the vaccine to certain tissues or cells, such as professional APCs, thereby facilitating the uptake of the mRNA vaccine by the desired type of immune cell and eventually leading to an enhanced immune response against the antigen of choice. However, this challenge has been overcome by complexing of mRNA with highly efficient carriers such as new generations of LNP described above, which protect the mRNA from ribonucleases and allow prolonged in vivo expression of the antigen of choice leading to the generation of potent humoral and cellular immune responses following in vivo administration.

The use of genetic KO of TRIM21, both in vitro and in mice, together with specific KO of the interaction on the protein level using engineered antibody variants have solidified the role of TRIM21 as a positive immune regulator whose activity is strictly dependent on detection of cytosolic antibody-virus complexes (19) .

Title: Trypsin-and low pH- mediated fusogenicity of avian metapneumovirus fusion proteins is determined by residues at positions 100, 101 and 294 OPEN 
Summary: Together, these findings demonstrated that the two residues at positions 100 and 101 in aMPV F proteins were determinants for aMPV F protein-induced membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin and that the addition of trypsin boosted the fusogenic activity of aMPV F 100Q101S mutants of all examined aMPV subtypes. As described above, the results showed that trypsin enhanced the fusogenicity of aMPV/C F protein, but not aMPV/A or aMPV/B F. To determine the mechanism of the observed difference in cell-cell fusion induced through F proteins of different aMPV subtypes, we reciprocally replaced the residues at positions 100 and 101 of the aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins and examined the effect of trypsin on fusion promotion.

Title: Poxvirus Exploitation of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System 
Summary: Although the poxviral ankyrin repeat proteins contain no obvious structural domains at their C-termini, many of the proteins display a conserved sequence, which upon closer inspection was shown to resemble the F-box domain that functions in the recruitment of substrates to the cellular SCF (Skp-1, cullin, F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex [82] [83] [84] . Although substrates have not been identified for the poxviral Ank/PRANC proteins, it has been hypothesized that the poxvirus Ank/PRANC proteins function as substrate adaptor proteins for the SCF complex.

Title: Respiratory Antiviral immunity and immunobiotics: Beneficial effects on inflammation-Coagulation interaction during influenza virus infection 
Summary: Therefore, the ability of immunobiotics to modulate the IFV-triggered immune-coagulative response could be explained by their direct influence on viral replication related to the enhancement of the antiviral state in the respiratory mucosa, and indirectly through the modulation of the inflammatory response. The early increase of proinflammatory mediators and the augmented levels of IFN-γ explain the ability of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 to diminish viral replication while the improved production of IL-10 would lead to a beneficial modulation of the immune-coagulative response which results in a reduced severity of lung damage.

Our reporter assays indicate that the L uAUG initiates translation as indicated by expression of constructs where the uORF was fused in frame with GFP and is further supported by the observation that expression of such constructs is enhanced by increasing the ''strength'' of the Kozak sequence surrounding the uAUG ( Figure 5 ).

Title: The Ebola Virus Nucleoprotein Recruits the Nuclear RNA Export Factor NXF1 into Inclusion Bodies to Facilitate Viral Protein Expression 
Summary: Similarly, NXF1-∆RBD also accumulated in inclusion bodies, indicating that the accumulation of RNA binding-deficient NXF1 in inclusion bodies is not due to the identified direct interaction of NP with the RBD of NXF1, but that NXF1 is recruited via another mechanism. Since the interaction of NP with NXF1 resembles that of Aly and NXF1, as it involves the RBD, but not the amino acids that are important for the interaction with RNA [31] , we propose a model in which a binding of NP to NXF1 results in a handover of viral mRNA from NP to NXF1 (Figure 8 ).

Title: CXCR2 Signaling Protects Oligodendrocytes and Restricts Demyelination in a Mouse Model of Viral-Induced Demyelination 
Summary: The prolonged and elevated expression of the CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA throughout the course of JHMV infection within the spinal cord, coupled with the localized CXCL1 expression within spinal cord white matter, implicate a potential role for CXCR2 signaling in host defense during chronic JHMV infection. JHMV infection of CXCR2 2/2 cultures resulted in a similar frequency of TUNEL reactive cells as compared to infected wildtype cells, yet CXCL1 did not protect oligodendrocyte cultures from undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 8A ), and this correlated with the presence of activated caspase 3, cleaved PARP, and no restoration of Bcl-2  This study has provided previously unappreciated evidence that CXCR2 signaling protects cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage from apoptosis in mice persistently infected with a demyelinating neurotropic virus.

Title: Design of Peptide-Based Nanovaccines Targeting Leading Antigens From Gynecological Cancers to Induce HLA-A2.1 Restricted CD8 + T Cell Responses 
Summary: Controversy remains in the literature on the nature of the peptides to be used in such vaccines in the context of cancer, ranging from (1) peptides representing only minimal native CD8 + T cell epitopes; (2) their agonist variants (to help break potential tolerance, or enhance MHC I binding or immunogenicity of peptides representing weak natural epitopes); (3) minimal peptide epitopes with added amino acids at either end, to promote stability in micro-environments which contain exopeptidases, as well as potentially promote appropriate cleavage or processing if the minimal epitopes are covalently conjugated to a nanoparticle; 4) the inclusion of CD4 + T cell epitopes, either by replicating in a peptide region from a protein that contains both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes, or constructing artificial constructs encompassing in one peptide containing CD8 + and CD4 + epitopes from different proteins. Additional of the amino acid sequence (AAY) at the flanking region of the WT1B peptide has been reported to promote appropriate processing and recognition of the minimal epitope (62) , but this was not observed in our study, as the incorporation of this sequence did not enhance responses to the minimal epitope WT1B, and even decreased the cross-reactive CD8 + T cell responses to the native WT1A antigen, when comparing WT1D-PSNPs and WT1E-PSNPs induced responses to the other formulations ( * p < 0.05 and * * p < 0.01, respectively) ( Figure 5) .

To further characterize the inhibition by L Ã of 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation, fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) assays based on the degradation of a labeled RNA probe [44] were performed in solution (Fig 7F and 7G) . On the one hand, replacing two amino acids stretches (26-28 and 47-51) of human RNase L by the corresponding mouse RNase L residues was sufficient to trigger interaction with L Ã and efficient L Ã -mediated inhibition of human RNase L. On the other hand, rat/mouse RNase L chimeras showed that residues 80, 81 in ANK R2 were also critical for L Ã interaction with RNase L and, to a lesser extent, for RNase L inhibition.

Title: Transfer of Anti-Rotavirus Antibodies during Pregnancy and in Milk Following Maternal Vaccination with a Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Amplicon Vector 
Summary: In conclusion, we were able to show that injection of the sWa[VP2/6/7] amplicon vector raises a RV specific immune response, detected as IgG in sera as well as in milk of immunized animals and that this response is passed to the offspring via both the placental and the lactogenic route. The salient new findings in our study include: (1) transduction of cells with our HSV-1 amplicon vector delivering a DNA cassette encoding a single polycistronic messenger RNA, comprising the codon-optimized sequences of the three RV capsid proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7, triggered the synthesis of all three encoded RV proteins; (2) cell-type dependent increase of the desired protein synthesis due to codon-optimization of the capsid protein coding sequences in the vector; (3) assembly of VP2 and VP6 into double-layered virus-like particles, while VP7 was synthesized in the same cell but, apparently, excluded from particle formation; (4) intramuscular inoculation of these amplicon particles resulted in the production of RV-specific antibodies against VP2 and VP6 but, interestingly, not VP7; (5) these antibodies were transferred to mouse progeny via the uterine and lactogenic pathway; and (6) despite efficient antibody transfer to offspring, clinical protection against diarrhea upon experimental infection of the pups with a heterologous, mouse-specific RV was not achieved.

Title: A Fusion-Inhibiting Peptide against Rift Valley Fever Virus Inhibits Multiple, Diverse Viruses 
Summary: As described in the Discussion, our data suggest a two-step mechanism for fusion inhibition like that reported earlier for DENV [18] in which the RVFV-6 peptide associates with the virion independent of Gc initially (e.g., binds to the viral membrane) but then specifically binds to Gc following the rearrangement in Gc triggered by the low pH treatment. In this report, we showed that a peptide (RVFV-6) analogous to the stem region of the putative fusion protein Gc of RVFV is capable of inhibiting multiple, diverse viruses in addition to RVFV.

Title: Activation of the Canonical Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Pathway during Lung Morphogenesis and Adult Lung Tissue Repair 
Summary: Double immunostaining for eGFP and CD31 (PECAM-1), a surface marker of mature endothelium, or VEGFR2, a surface marker of vascular progenitor cells ( Figure  S1 ), demonstrated that the majority of CD31 pos or VEGFR2 pos cells at E12, E14.5 and E17 were also eGFP pos ( Figure 3A ), confirming that the network of eGFP pos cells in the parenchyma is composed of vascular cells and that the canonical BMP pathway is activated during the establishment of the vascular network in the developing lung. Reactivation of the BRE-eGFP reporter in adult lung after tissue injury suggests an active role of BMP-signaling in adult lung repair after injury The dramatic decline of eGFP expression in the adult lung of the BRE-eGFP reporter mice and the association of eGFP expression with the epithelial progenitor pool prompted us to investigate whether the reporter was reactivated in adult lung during injury and repair.

Summary: Bovine Beta-Lactoglobulin Binds to the L1 Protein and the Peptides Derived From the Positively Charged Residue-Enriched Region in Human Papillomavirus L1 Protein As we proposed before, 3HP-β-LG inhibited HPV PsV entry into the target cell possibly through the binding of the negatively charged residues in 3HP-β-LG with the positively charged residues in a protein on the surface of the viral particle, thereby blocking the interaction between viral protein and receptor on the target cell (Lu et al., 2013) . To determine whether 3HP-β-LG could also bind to the receptor on the target cell surface to block HPV entry, we incubated HeLa cells with 3HP-β-LG (control: β-LG) at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were washed with DMEM to remove the unbound proteins, or not washed (as control), before addition of HPV PsV.

Title: HCoV interactions with renin-angiotensin proteases Renin-angiotensin system in human coronavirus pathogenesis 
Summary: Ang (1-7) induces multiple actions (i.e., vasodilatation and cellular growth inhibition) that appear to counter balance most of the physiologic responses initiated by Ang II [ Linear enzymatic cascade depicted in the middle represents the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and yields the effector peptide Ang II that can interact with AT 1 R or AT 2 R. The more complex RAS is capable of producing additional biologically active angiotensin fragments with independent actions, including Ang III, Ang (1-7) and Ang IV. A reduction in cardiac ACE2 expression most likely results in locally elevated levels of Ang II and might, therefore, also account for these pathophysiological processes, by Ang II-mediated activation of AT 1 receptors and loss of the protective effects of Ang (1-7) [57, 112] .

Therefore, although H5N1 viruses tend to induce higher level of cytokines in primary epithelial cells than H1N1, there is no clear consensus regarding the innate immune responses induced by IAV of different origin, which might be explained by the use of different strains and subtypes, high genotypic variability and the differential contribution of the viral proteins to the induction or evasion of the immune system.

Title: Autographa californica Multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus Ac34 Protein Retains Cellular Actin-Related Protein 2/3 Complex in the Nucleus by Subversion of CRM1- Dependent Nuclear Export a11111 OPEN ACCESS

When P40 was co-expressed in bacmid-transfected cells, only vAc34K-O ac34 could induce P40 nuclear accumulation at 48 hpt, in contrast to the cytoplasmic distribution pattern of P40 in vAc34KO egfp and vAc34KO ac34Δ195-215 -transfected cells ( Fig 4A) .

In chronic hepatitis B, the potential advantage of anti-HBs humAb therapy relies on the possibility to regenerate effective T cell responses in patients with chronic HBV infection whose T cells are dysfunctional as a result of exposure to very large amounts of HBV envelope proteins produced in excess during viral replication.

Title: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and the Control of Herpesvirus Infections 
Summary: Thus, the mechanisms that terminate the production of innate cytokines by pDCs during responses to viral type stimuli may not only be in place to prevent the development of a cytokine shock but also to switch pDC functions towards direct activation of adaptive immunity once their initial role in the orchestration of innate immune defenses has been fulfilled. Thus, it is unlikely that this mechanism plays a significant proviral role to the disadvantage of the host during infections with most herpesviruses in vivo, as systemic production of IFN-I by pDCs should lead to the induction of antiviral defenses in most cells before they encounter the virus.

Summary: To investigate the antiviral activity of the NO-generating compound GSNO during PCV2 infection in vitro, 80% confluent PK-15 cells in 24-well cell culture plates were pretreated with GSNO or GSNO plus hemoglobin (Hb) for 6 h, and then infected with PCV2 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1) in the presence of the drugs for an additional 72 h. Untreated cells, cultured in medium alone, were used as the mock control, and cells infected with PCV2 alone (MOI = 1) were used as the PCV2infected control. When monolayers reached about 80% in each well of 24-well cell culture plates, the cells were incubated with 125 μM GSNO or 125 μM GSNO plus Hb (5, 10, 20 μM) for 6 h, with four wells for each treatment, then the cells were infected with PCV2 (1 MOI) in the presence of various drugs for another 72 h. Non-treated cells served as the mock, and the infected cells without drug treatment were considered as the PCV2-infected control.

Title: Camouflage and interception: how pathogens evade detection by intracellular nucleic acid sensors 
Summary: The activity of RIG-I and MDA5 is tightly regulated in the cell: In the absence of infection, the CARD of the RNA sensors are kept in a phosphorylated state, and activation involves their dephosphorylation catalysed by protein phosphatase 1. Pathogens also hinder multiple aspects of STING function through proteolytic cleavage, degradation, blocking its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and preventing interaction with downstream signalling proteins, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1 While the production of type I interferons is not always an effective strategy to limit bacterial infections, the activation of STING by bacterial DNA or cyclic dinucleotides can also promote autophagy to clear bacteria from the infected cells.

Although the permeability studies were performed in the absence of trypsin, and therefore only one round of replication occurred, it is possible that the varying levels of unprocessed viral particles (lower levels with IFN-β pretreatment and higher levels in the presence of an IFN-β neutralizing antibody compared to control cells) could contribute to the differences in barrier permeability since astrovirus-induced barrier permeability is independent of viral replication [68] .

Summary: The primary function of S-palmitoylation at C72 and the neighboring C71 is likely the targeting or anchoring of a highly conserved amphipathic helix (59-VWSLFNTLFM-68 in human IFITM3) that is required for inhibition of membrane fusion by IFITM3 and that is adjacent to these S-palmitoylation sites in the IFITM3 amino acid sequence ( Fig. The well-defined ability of IFITM3 to prevent infection of cells by influenza virus, along with the increased virus-induced morbidity and mortality of IFITM3 KO mice, has prompted numerous research groups to examine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human IFITM3 gene associate with influenza virus infections or infection severity (all studies to date are summarized in Table 2 ).

Title: A Co-Opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase Enhances Tombusvirus Plus-Strand Synthesis 
Summary: Interestingly, addition of purified Ded1p to the tombusvirus replicase assay containing the short RNA/DNA duplex ( Figure 7A Non-overlapping functions of Ded1p and GAPDH in promoting initiation by the tombusvirus replicase GAPDH (Tdh2p in yeast) RNA binding protein is also a host factor stimulating (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase [25, 50] . Since the viral replication proteins were shown to bind to TBSV (2)RNA nonspecifically [57] , we propose that the above host proteins, which bind strongly to the TBSV (2)repRNA, are involved in facilitating the proper and efficient recruitment of the p92 RdRp protein to the (2)RNA template (or alternatively to the dsRNA intermediate) within the VRC as shown in Figure 9 .

Title: Topological Small-World Organization of the Fibroblastic Reticular Cell Network Determines Lymph Node Functionality 
Summary: Importantly, the topological model predicts that network robustness is not significantly reduced when 37% of the FRCs are ablated, while ablation of >50% of FRCs, i.e., at doses of 1 and 2 ng/g DT, will lead to a significant reduction of network robustness (Fig 6D) . Labeling of the CD8 + T cells with an Robust Small-World Organization of the FRC Network intracellular dye revealed that proliferation of the cells was substantially affected at DT doses of !1 ng/g (Fig 7I) , suggesting that activation of naïve CD8 + T cells by DCs can be maintained as long as approximately 50% of the FRC network remains intact.

Title: Increasing the CpG dinucleotide abundance in the HIV-1 genomic RNA inhibits viral replication 
Summary: Because CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in HIV-1 (Table 1) [40, 44, [55] [56] [57] and previous reports have shown that increasing the CpG dinucleotide abundance inhibits picornavirus and influenza virus replication [71] [72] [73] [74] , we hypothesized that the increased number of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 could cause the decrease in HIV-1 infectious virion production. This supports the hypothesis that the decrease in infectivity for HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 is due to the introduced CpG dinucleotides and not changes in the A-rich nucleotide bias.

Summary: For chronic viruses with slow rates of within-host evolution, such as HTLV-1 and HBV, the entire within-host population will be founder-like, and therefore transmitted viruses will be representative of the viruses present in the donor at the time of transmission. If there is heterogeneity in the rates of evolution among different within-host viral lineages, and if more slowly evolving lineages are more likely to be transmitted because they contain fewer transmissionreducing mutations, the rate of evolution of the virus at the between-host level will be slower than the rate of evolution measured at the within-host level (indicated by the red line).

Title: A Leaderless Genome Identified during Persistent Bovine Coronavirus Infection Is Associated with Attenuation of Gene Expression 
Summary: In contrast to the results indicating that the MHV DI RNA leader sequence is nonessential for negative-strand synthesis, the BCoV DI RNA leader sequence was required for the efficient synthesis of its negative-strand counter-recombinant between the BCoV genome and input DI RNA, the primers EGFP1(+), which anneals to the EGFP sequence and was used for RT, and M3 (2) , which anneals to the BCoV M protein gene, were used for PCR to detect potential recombination between the BCoV genome and DIEGFP (lane19) or D69EGFP (lane 20). Additionally, different from the results in which the deletion of the sequence between nt 25 and 59 within the MHV DI RNA leader sequence almost blocked sgmRNA synthesis [21] , the results of the present study suggest that the leaderless BCoV DI RNA was still able to synthesize sgmRNAs although the efficiency of sgmRNA synthesis from the BCoV leaderless DI RNA was ,2-to ,3-fold less than that from the leader-containing BCoV DI RNA during the 48 h of infection (Fig.

To further verify the effects of the eIF4F complex on rotavirus infection, a lentiviral shRNA-mediated loss-of-function assay was performed to silence PDCD4, which indicated that one out of three shRNA vectors (No 1) exerted a potent knockdown  PDCD4 functions by inhibiting the translation by directly inhibiting the helicase activity of eIF4A to competitively bind to the scaffold protein eIF4G.

Title: Type I IFN Signaling Is Dispensable during Secondary Viral Infection

In addition to being involved in attrition, direct IFNα/β signaling leads to the specific upregulation of MHC Class I and Qa-1 on CD8 + T cells during in vitro stimulation and/or primary viral infection in vivo, and the failure to appropriately upregulate these and other inhibitory molecules allows the cells to be attacked by NK cells, limiting the expansion of the virus-specific CD8 + T cells [21] .

Title: Mosquito cell-derived West Nile virus replicon particles mimic arbovirus inoculum and have reduced spread in mice 
Summary: In summary, both the BHK-RPs and C6/36-RPs replicated in skin at the inoculation site, draining lymph nodes, and spleen, but there was more rapid and greater spread of the BHK-RPs to distant lymphoid tissues, suggesting that either RP-infected cells or RPs from the inoculum are moving through the blood to distant tissue sites. Like the study with RPs, the mammalian cell-derived WNV exhibited greater spread from the site of inoculation to the draining lymph node and into the blood compared to the mosquito cell-derived WNV (Fig 7) .

Given that the ISG15 2/2 pups infected at 9 days of age displayed a dramatic increase in lethality, with kinetics similar to that observed in the IFNAR 2/2 mice, we expected to detect increased viral titers in the ISG15 2/2 mice.

Title: Hemorrhagic Fever-Causing Arenaviruses: Lethal Pathogens and Potent Immune Suppressors 
Summary: As evidenced by the tight control of gene expression and viral RNA localization within cells, it is clear that regulation of viral RNA levels and localization is a critical mechanism of the virus life cycle to allow for maximum replication without being quenched early in the cycle by the innate immune response, which may explain the absolute conservation of IFN1 inhibition by arenaviral NP proteins. These studies illustrate the current lack of detail understanding of the roles of the different viral proteins, including arenaviral NPs, to inhibit PACT-mediated RIG-I activation, and the nature of the dsRNAs (viral, cellular, or both) that may intimately be involved in this process.

Summary: IAV are particularly wellsuited for the study of neutrophils in viral respiratory disease, since they are well-studied in humans and animal models, and it is well-established that infection with specific viral variants (i.e., genetic point mutations) alter the course of disease from mild to severe (28). Although neutrophils are an important component of the general response to infection in the respiratory system, as is discussed herein, neutrophils are capable of recognizing viruses (via viral PAMPs), responding to viruses with specific effector functions, and may be instrumental in determining disease outcome.

Title: Yeast for virus research 
Summary: A number of experimental tools could or have been used in yeasts to study life cycle of (+)ssRNA viruses, e.g., 1) an entire viral RNA genome could be transcribed from yeast plasmids and transfected into yeast cells [94, 95] , 2) both viral RdRP and cellular proteins could be provided in-trans to test for their roles in viral replication [96] , and 3) yeast genomic and cDNA libraries as well as the genomewide gene knock-out libraries were used to study virus-cell interactions [24, 28, 46, 97] . For example, molecular cloning of a viral gene into one of the pYZ3N-GFP-carrying vectors generates a 5' GFP-tagged viral protein that can be used for the determination of its subcellular localization; the pYZ1N gene expression vector and its derivatives are used for functional characterization of a viral protein without the GFP tag; 2) all of the gene cloning is done in an unidirectional fashion with positive identification of the gene insertions, based on α-complementation of X-gal in Escherichia coli; 3) an inducible gene transcriptional no message in the thiamine (nmt1) promoter [68, 196] is used to allow measurement of the viral gene-specific effect; 4) three different strengths of the nmt1 promoter (high, intermediate and low) with two different cell growth selection markers (leu2 and ura4) [68, 196] allow testing of gene expression at various levels or testing of viral protein-to-protein interactions [68, 196] ; and 5) multiple viral gene-producing yeast strains can be established and maintained that allow simultaneous viral gene testing , thus facilitating functional characterization of a small viral genome.

Title: Opposite Roles of RNase and Kinase Activities of Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) on HSV-1 Replication 
Summary: When cells were pretreated with both APY29 and STF-083010 and then infected with HSV-1, APY29 showed an inhibitory effect on viral replication independent of the presence of STF-083010 ( Figure 3D) , suggests that the suppression of kinase activity of IRE1α by APY29 is sufficient to inhibit viral replication. In agreement with earlier studies that IRE1-XBP1 arm of UPR was inactivated or suppressed by HSV-1 infection [27, 29, 30] , we further presented evidence that the activation of the RNase activity of IRE1α is detrimental to HSV-1 replication, and suppression of the RNase activity may serve as a mechanism for the virus to escape from host restriction.

Title:  
Summary: Our results showed that CLEC4M suppressed the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 that was induced by cisplatin in NSCLC cells; when CLEC4M expression is suppressed, the cisplatin-induced upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 was further increased, suggesting that CLEC4M inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells, which might be the molecular underpinnings of the role of CLEC4M in cisplatin resistance. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that higher expression of CLEC4M is associated with poor clinical prognosis in lung cancer patients and enhances the resistance of NSCLC cells to cisplatin.

Title: The impact of the interferon-lambda family on the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections 
Summary: [121] [122] [123] [124] 130, 131 The paradoxical situation of higher ISG expression in IFNL3 SNPs despite lower IFNL3 gene expression could be explained by (i) a disruption in the temporal regulatory aspects of type-I and -III IFNsignaling cascades (at the level of either ligand or receptor); or (ii) the actual expression of IFNL4 in the context of reduced IFNL3 by Interferon-lambda on innate and adaptive immunity A Egli et al 5 virtue of high IFNL SNP linkage. Interferon-lambda on innate and adaptive immunity A Egli et al 6 At present, we would propose that the higher baseline expression of ISGs in patients with a minor allele genotype arises due to a combination of persistent activation of the IFN-a signaling cascade and a general reduction of inhibitory signals such as USP18 due to relative reductions in IFNL3 expression.

Title: Myosins 1 and 6, myosin light chain kinase, actin and microtubules cooperate during antibody-mediated internalisation and trafficking of membrane-expressed viral antigens in feline infectious peritonitis virus infected monocytes 
Summary: It was found that the internalisation in the presence of both inhibitors was reduced to 3 ± 5%, which is not significantly different from the inhibition assay with ML-7 alone, which indicate that active MLCK is required for the initiation of the internalisation process (see Figure 5D for a cell treated with Latrunculin B and ML-7 at 30 min post antibody addition). This is suggested by (1) the co-localisation kinetics in which myosin 1 co-localises with the visualised MLCK isoform before and during the internalisation process, (2) the finding that recruitment of myosin 1 to the antigen-antibody complexes is hampered by treatment with ML-7.

Overall, the ACE2-Fc fusion protein would have many of the same benefits of a traditional neutralizing antibody that would be sought as a treatment for the infection, but represent one with maximal breadth and potency since the 2019-nCoV could not escape its neutralization, given the same protein is also its receptor for cell entry.

Title: iCa 2+ Flux, ROS and IL-10 Determines Cytotoxic, and Suppressor T Cell Functions in Chronic Human Viral Infections 
Summary: Chronic activation of cytotoxic T cells lead to loss of cytotoxic function and gain of immune suppressive capabilities and was marked by altered iCa 2+ influx, significant decrease in IFNγ and Gr B and increase in IL-10. As the combined function of IFN-γ, Gr B and Perforin-C is responsible for functional execution of cytotoxicity in Tc1 cells, we examined for Gr B expression in chronic activation, in IL-10 KO mice and with iCa 2+ influx inhibitors.

Production of Defective Interfering Particles of Influenza A Virus in Parallel Continuous Cultures at Two Residence Times-Insights From qPCR Measurements and Viral Dynamics Modeling 
Summary: For infection, the DIP-containing virus seed (A/PR/8/34-delS1(1)) was added to the VB1 and VB2 at an MOI of 0.1 based on the viable cell count and the TCID 50 titer of the virus seed at 50 h of culture. Most likely, the higher infectious titer for the longer RT of 36 h was related to the reduced wash-out (lower dilution rate) compared to RT 22 h. In total, three cycles were observed for the short RT with a second and a third peak of ∼3·10 6 virions/mL at 12 and 18 days p.i., respectively (Figure 4A) .

We further demonstrate that this synergy was mediated by the interaction between dsRNA (an intermediate of viral replication) and IFN c in vitro and in vivo. 1A , well differentiated HBE cells demonstrated significant synergistic induction of CXCL10 mRNA following infection with the MEM influenza virus and treatment with IFN c. CXCL10 induction was also significantly elevated following the combined treatment of MEM and IFN c treatment as compared to the treatment with IFN c alone.

The exploitation of polyamines by viruses is also evident in light of the viral mechanisms that manipulate the biosynthesis of polyamines.

Title: Cleavage of a Neuroinvasive Human Respiratory Virus Spike Glycoprotein by Proprotein Convertases Modulates Neurovirulence and Virus Spread within the Central Nervous System 
Summary: In order to evaluate whether this cleavage of the viral S protein also took place in human cells, we made use of the differentiated LA-N-5 neuronal cell line described in the Materials and Methods section [27] and showed, first, that the kinetics of viral replication was similar to that observed between both viruses in murine primary cells (Fig 7A and 7B) , as there was a significant increase of virus release for the rOC/S G758R mutant and, second, that the cleavage of the S protein into S1/S2 fragments was again predominantly detected in the cell culture supernatant (Fig 7D) compared to the protein associated with cells ( Fig 7C) . The difference in viral spread within CNS and in brain primary cultures, associated with the increase of infectious viral particles in the culture medium for the virus harboring the G758R mutation present in all known clinical isolates, as well as the absence of modification in infectivity between the two viruses, strongly suggests that the PC-activity-associated cleavage of HCoV-OC43 S protein plays a more important role during the egress and viral budding from infected cells, which could influence the mode of viral transmission between CNS cells.

Summary: Thus, to identify functionally/structurally significant nucleotides in the CNE and to determine whether the proteinbinding sites found in the AcMNPV CNE are sufficiently conserved across alphabaculoviruses to be considered as elements associated with the conserved function of the CNE, a consensus sequence was determined by comparing 38 aligned CNEs ( Figure 2A ). Although the position of the linearization site in the AcMNPV ie2-pe38 intergenic region was not precisely determined by the authors of the work, the location of the linearization site within the ManeNPV CNE strongly suggests that the analogous site may be a requisite of the AcMNPV CNE.

The invading immune cells in the eye could also be exacerbating the severity of the complications and damaging the retina and blood vessels due to their response to control the infection.

Summary: Mice were infected with a dose of the mouse adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) IAV that was known to cause severe disease in several of the CC founder strains (C57BL/6J, 129s1/ SvImJ, A/J), and we assessed IAV-induced weight loss (measured as a percentage of starting weight) and clinical disease daily through four days post infection (D4), at which point the mice were euthanized and lung tissue assessed for viral replication, virus-induced inflammation and pathology, and (pre-CC mice only) transcriptional profiles by microarray analysis within the lungs (Table 1, Table S1 , Dataset S1). Because of the inherent genome structure of the founder strains [47] , it would be difficult to differentiate between the disassociated effects of the CAST/EiJ Mx1 allele we found in the pre-CC population and the alternate hypothesis that CAST/EiJ's Mx1 was completely nonfunctional, and that there was another polymorphic gene within CAST/EiJ that provided some protection from clinical disease.

Title: Caveolin-1 Associated Adenovirus Entry into Human Corneal Cells 
Summary: To test whether viral entry is cell and/or virus specific as previously shown for HAdV-C [50] , we directly compared pathways of infection in human corneal fibroblasts and A549 cells using HAdV-D37 and HAdV-C2. Co-localization of virus and CTXB was observed in the cell membrane at 30 min, cytoplasm at 60 min, and perinuclear region at 90 min, supporting a role for caveolin-1 and lipid rafts in HAdV-D37 entry into corneal cells.

Title: Minimal within-host dengue models highlight the specific roles of the immune response in primary and secondary dengue infections 
Summary: We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. We have shown that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the features of a primary dengue infection, and that for a secondary dengue infection, a higher rate of viral infectivity (representing ADE) is needed to recover the higher peak viraemia value and the shorter time to peak viraemia, while T cells are needed to recover the higher viral clearance rate.

Title: The S2 Subunit of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Beaudette Is a Determinant of Cellular Tropism 
Summary: These results show that the loss of the BSM abolished the ability of Beau-R to grow on Vero cells and that the accruement of the BSM resulted in the ability of an rIBV expressing the M41 S to have a tropism for growth on Vero cells, albeit to a lesser extent than replacement with the entire Beaudette S2. As shown above, passage of BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK on Vero cells improved the growth of this virus in Vero cells; therefore, the rIBVs with the additional Beaudettederived amino acids in the M41 S2 subunit were passaged on Vero cells, and the P 7 -Vero isolates were reexamined for growth on Vero cells.

Title: Targeting Antigens to Dendritic Cell Receptors for Vaccine Development 
Summary: CIRE (C-type lectin immune receptor, CD209) is a murine type 2 membrane protein which belongs to the C-type lectin receptors and is preferentially expressed by immature CD8− splenic DCs (CD8−CD4+ and CD8−CD4−), on some CD4+ DCs, and on plasmacytoid pre-DCs, with no expression on CD8+ DCs, macrophages, or monocytes (Table 1 and Figure 1 ) [113] . Anti-DNGR-1 monoclonal antibody covalently conjugated to CD8+ peptide from OVA, induced OT-I CD8+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion in vivo, and only CD8+ DCs and not plasmacytoid DCs were involved in the presentation of the peptide to CD8+ T cells [146] .

In order to help determine the possible antiviral mechanism of Kn2-7 peptide, four different treatment groups were designed for comparison of the antiviral effect as following: (1) peptide pretreated group, TZM-bl cells were pretreated with 10 mg/ml peptide at 37uC for 1 h and then treated with HIV-1 PV; (2) infection first group, TZM-bl cells were infected with HIV-1 PV first by inoculating at 37uC for 1 h and then treated with 10 mg/ ml peptide; (3) peptide/virus mixture group, TZM-bl cells were treated with mixture of HIV-1 PV and 10 mg/ml peptides immediately after mix but without inoculation; and (4) peptide/ virus pre-incubation group, TZM-bl cells were infected with mixture of HIV-1 PV and 10 mg/ml peptides pre-incubating at 37uC for 1 h. To compare the effects of peptide to viral infection, TZM-bl cells were measured by luciferase activity assay after 48 h incubation as described above.

Title: Strain-Specific Antagonism of the Human H1N1 Influenza A Virus against Equine Tetherin 
Summary: In order to investigate whether the infection of SC09 r×HBG HA/NA and SC09 caused different subcellular localization of tetherins, and whether SC09 r×HBG HA/NA could subsequently release effectively from tetherin-expressing cells, we studied the localization of eqTHN and huTHN in cells infected with either SC09 r×HBG HA/NA or SC09. The release of SC09HA A13T and SC09HA I49L was markedly inhibited compared with that of SC09rHBG HA, showing that viruses with a single point mutation in HA almost completely lost the ability to overcome eqTHN restriction ( Figure 5F ), while mutants with a single point mutation in NA could still greatly enhance release of In order to analyze the effect of HA and NA individually on eqTHN resistance, we constructed an SC09-derived 7 + 1 reassortant virus expressing the either HA or NA of HBG (SC09 rHBG HA or SC09 rHBG NA ), to infect both eqTHN-expressing and control cells.

Title: Surviving Deadly Lung infections: innate Host Tolerance Mechanisms in the Pulmonary System 
Summary: Viral infections of the lung are often characterized by early inflammatory responses from both the lung epithelium and innate immune cells in an attempt to clear the virus, as well as resultant damage done to the tissue by both the virus and the immune response mounted to the virus. The maintenance of barrier function between the lumen of the lung and the bloodstream is one of the primary functions of respiratory epithelial cells and is critical in tolerance of pulmonary infection.

Title: Differential Host Cell Gene Expression and Regulation of Cell Cycle Progression by Nonstructural Protein 11 of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 
Summary: Thus, the regulatory function of nsp11 for IFN induction was first examined in MARC-nsp11 cells and in MARC-145 cells transfected with the nsp11 gene. In two independent experiments, the MARC-nsp11 cells at the S phase constituted 28.5% (Figure 4(b) ) as compared to 12.6% for MARC-145 cells (Figure 4(a) ), which was more than a 2-fold increase for nsp11-expressing cells indicating that MARC-nsp11 cells were accumulating at the S phase by 24 h. To examine the nature of DNA accumulation at the S phase by nsp11, cells were pulsed-labeled for 10 min, 20 min, or 24 h with BrdU and stained for BrdU incorporation and lamins.

Summary: In addition, the mRNA levels of both pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα) and anti-inflammatory (IFNβ, IL-4, and IL-10) cytokines increased in response to CHME3 cell infection with the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) [53, 54] cells was not included in the paper, and it is difficult to extrapolate from a previous study [34] , in which a biological assay was employed to measure the cytokine's production in place of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) adopted later. Though the CCR10 receptor protein could not be measured by flow cytometry (due to the lack of specific antibodies at that time), an indirect evidence of the expression of this receptor on the surface of the CHME3 cells was obtained by evaluating the migration capacity of the cells in response to IP-10 [38] .

Title: Experimental Data-Mining Analyses Reveal New Roles of Low-Intensity Ultrasound in Differentiating Cell Death Regulatome in Cancer and Non-cancer Cells via Potential Modulation of Chromatin Long-Range Interactions 
Summary: Taken together, these results suggest that first, LIUS exerts a profound effect on cell the gene expression of the cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells; second, LIUS treatment has the tendency to reduce the expression of cell death regulators than activating them in non-cancer cells; third, in non-cancer cells, the death regulators that are downregulated by LIUS attenuate several inflammatory signaling pathways. Most of the cell death regulator genes downregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are responsible for mediating inflammatory signaling pathways; (2) LIUS inhibits the expression of several inflammatory cell death regulators potentially via TP53-, and SRF-, mediated pathways in cancer cells and non-cancer cells, respectively; (3) Thermal effects and osmotic shear stress associated with LIUS may play a role in altering the cell death regulator expression patterns; (4) LIUS has the tendency to induce antioxidant effects specifically in noncancer cells; and (5) The genes that were modulated in cancer cells by LIUS have unique CLRI patterns, different from that of non-cancer cells.

Title: Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites OPEN 
Summary: Considering (i) the expression of SSEA-1 and-3 in our recently identified hematopoietic cell-derived multipotent stem cells, and (ii) that the factor to induce hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation is expressed and released from proliferating skin fibroblasts, in this study therefore we aimed to investigate whether SSEA-positive, hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells are present in the wound site and whether there is correlation among skin injury, M-CSF at the wound environment, SSEA-positive cells in the wound site, and skin wound healing. To further confirm SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin are the same type of stem cells induced by M-CSF as previously reported 24 , we examined the expression of the M-CSF receptor in SSEA-1 positive cells by staining wounded skin with both antibodies.

Title: NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases associate with LCMV Z's PPXY domain and are required for virus budding, but not via direct ubiquitination of Z 
Summary: If the role of Z's PPXY late domain is to recruit Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases in order to mediate protein ubiquitination, presumably there are ubiquitin-binding proteins that can recognize these ubiquitinated substrates and link viral proteins to the ESCRT pathway. Surprisingly, direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z by Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases was not required for LCMV particle release, suggesting that other viral and/or host proteins may serve as important targets of ubiquitination to link Z to the ESCRT pathway.

Title: The autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) positively regulates HCV replication and is required for wild-type membranous web formation OPEN 
Summary: The autophagy elongation complex proteins (ATG5-12 and ATG16L1) were also detected in the purified MW from NS4B HA replicon cells, but not in the control extract, thus indicating that the elongation complex is indeed present at the HCV replication site. In addition, the co-purification of the elongation complex proteins with the MW suggested that the ATG5-NS5B interaction previously described by our laboratory 34 might actually participate in targeting of the elongation complex to the MW and/or in supplying of autophagic isolation membranes for the formation of the virus-induced vesicles.

Title: Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bc and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis 
Summary: To test if the stimulating activity of eEF1Bc on the in vitro RdRp activity was due to binding of eEF1Bc to the (+)RNA template and/or to the TCV RdRp protein, we performed assays, in which the recombinant eEF1Bc was pre-incubated with the TCV RdRp or the (+)RNA template prior to the RdRp assay. The binding of the RNA by eEF1Bc promotes the opening of the closed 39-terminal structure, whereas eEF1A facilitates the proper and efficient binding of the RdRp to the 39 terminal RSE sequence of the viral RNA, which is required for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [11, 39] , prior to initiation of (-)-strand synthesis (Figure 9 ) [23, 24] .

We do not know what is the effect of such a deletion in the case of the S proteins of bat CoV but the above experiments were also performed with native S proteins and the result was the same, i.e the S protein of SARS-CoV infected hACE2-expressing cells whereas the S proteins of the two bat SARSr-CoV were unable to mediate infection (not shown).

Given the key role of co-receptor CD4 and CD8 in process, it was assumed that their ability to bind, respectively, the membrane-proximal α2 and β2 domains of the MHC class II molecule and the protruding loop in the α3 domain of the MHC class I molecule will constrain the docking geometry of the TCR to the pMHC (Figure 1) .

Title: Exchange of amino acids in the H1-haemagglutinin to H3 residues is required for efficient influenza A virus replication and pathology in Tmprss2 knock-out mice 
Summary: These results demonstrate that the exchange of the HA-loop alone from H1-HA to H3-HA is not sufficient to cause strong body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 À/À mice, suggesting that additional amino acids outside the HA-loop region are required for this phenotype. In conclusion, the exchange of the H3-HA-loop alone for the H1-HA-loop allows for HA cleavage but does not result in high viral replication or pathology (survival, body weight loss, lung damage) in infected Tmprss2 À/À mice.

Title: Antigenic Subversion: A Novel Mechanism of Host Immune Evasion by Ebola Virus 
Summary: In mice immunized against GP 1,2 in the presence of sGP, an immunization strategy designed to simulate antigen exposure during natural infection, we observed that most resulting anti-GP 1,2 antibodies were cross reactive with and thus susceptible to competition by sGP, even though the titers of anti-GP 1,2 antibodies in these mice were similar to the titers in mice immunized against GP 1,2 alone. Pooled antisera were analyzed from immunized mice at week 6 and the ability of sGP to compete for anti-GP 1,2 antibodies was determined by competition ELISA as described in Figure 3B .

Title: Converting monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapies from passive to active: bringing immune complexes into play 
Summary: 31 In addition to controlling the viral propagation by these mechanisms, the opsonization of viral particles and/or infected cells by therapeutic antiviral mAbs of the IgG type leads to the formation of immune complexes (ICs) recognizable by the FcγRs expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs. To understand the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of antiviral responses by ICs, several in vitro studies have addressed whether antibody-mediated viral uptake by DCs could lead to stronger activation of these cells and the development of stronger virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in an Fc-dependent manner.

Summary: Moreover, we show that the size profile of small RNAs produced by host pathways is unique to each virus and can be used as a signature to classify and identify viral contigs independent of sequence similarity comparisons to known references. Consistent with the small RNA profile similarity, contigs in cluster 3 are detected in the same libraries as the LPRV1 RdRP while contigs in cluster 8 follow the expression of the RdRP of LPRV2 (data not shown).

Summary: Once folded in the cytoplasm, proteins can accumulate in the same cell compartment, or be exported to the periplasm by the Tat-pathway, or be secreted to the medium by the type I secretion system. However, in the case of Ragi bifunctional inhibitor, a protein with five overlapping disulfide bonds, DsbA activity resulted in the accumulation of non-native intermediates, whilst the availability of DsbC significantly increased the yield of the native protein both in vitro and in vivo [51] .

Activation of PRRs in these cells by virus infection triggers production and release of type I and III interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides) which initiate the host innate and adaptive immune response.

Summary: While the exact mechanism of the antiviral activity of LL-37 against RSV is not well established, it is speculated that the peptide directly interacts with the virus prior to infection due to its dose-dependent early effects on RSV infection. Pre-treatment of human microglial cells with LL-37 prior to infection also resulted in a significant reduction in VEEV titers, suggesting entry prevention is not the only mechanism of LL-37-mediated inhibition.

Title: Both STING and MAVS Fish Orthologs Contribute to the Induction of Interferon Mediated by RIG-I 
Summary: RIG-I is the most upstream molecule and IRF3 the most downstream molecule involved in triggering the activation of IFN type-I promoter in response to RNA viruses (see [11] for review), thus it was of interest to examine the implication of MAVS and STING molecules in this pathway. In contrast, the negative-dominant mutants of MAVS, MAVSDCard which lacks the CARD-like domain [33] , and STING, STING Cter which corresponds to the 223 C-terminal amino acids, have a significant effect on RIG-I Nter induction of IFN1 promoter by reducing it to 2-and 3-fold, respectively  Structural analysis of the human STING revealed that the protein contains four hydrophobic transmembrane domains and is inserted in the membrane of the ER [21, 52] .

Title: Systems Analysis of a RIG-I Agonist Inducing Broad Spectrum Inhibition of Virus Infectivity 
Summary: In A549 cells treated with 59pppRNA, knocking down RIG-I abolished IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation, as well as IFIT1 and RIG-I upregulation compared to control siRNA-treated cells (  To evaluate the breadth of the host intrinsic response resulting from RNA agonist stimulation of RIG-I, modulation of the transcriptome of A549 cells stimulated with 59pppRNA from 1 to 48 h was analysed by gene array using the Illumina platform. For the first time, an RNA-based agonist of RIG-I was shown to block the replication of multiple viruses; this broad-spectrum antiviral activity of 59pppRNA is attributable in part to a potent stimulation of the inflammatory and antiviral response driven by the early induction of IRF, NF-kB, STAT, chemokines and proinflammatory cytokine genes.

Summary: While studies have shown that transfected LASV RNA can activate the IFN-β promoter in a RIG-I-dependent manner [58] , IFN-β expression is not upregulated in the context of LASV infection [59] , indicating that LASV efficiently evades or inhibits the IFN response in the context of virus infection. One possibility is that the IFN antagonist activities of the NPs of pathogenic NW arenaviruses (JUNV and MACV) are weaker than that of LASV NP during virus infection, explaining why the RIG-I/IRF3 signaling pathway is active in JUNV and MACV but not in LASV infection.

Summary: We subsequently removed the C-terminal motifs from the S YN144 (S YN144 ∆ERRS ) and evaluated the syncytium formation in transfected VeroE6-APN cells in the presence and absence of trypsin. It is also important to note that S G2∆ERRS , though it displayed strong surface expression, could not form detectable syncytium in VeroE6-APN cells (Figure 2A) , which further supports the notion that the surface expression is not sufficient for promoting syncytium formation in cells expressing PEDV S. In addition, results from this study lead us to speculate that regions outside the C-terminal motifs might play a role in the S-mediated formation of syncytium in VeroE6 cells.

Title: MuRF2 regulates PPARγ1 activity to protect against diabetic cardiomyopathy and enhance weight gain induced by a high fat diet 
Summary: Since MuRF2 has been reported in the heart and skeletal muscle, in addition to the liver, we measured cardiac triglycerides and glycogen after 26 weeks of high fat diet to determine if alterations in these storage forms of fat and glucose could be contributing to the increased heart weight or dysfunction in the MuRF2−/− hearts (Fig. After challenge with PPAR ligands (free fatty acids from high fat diet) for 26 weeks, no differences in MuRF2−/− cardiac PPARα and PPARγ1 were identified by immunoblot analysis, but a significant increase in PPARβ protein expression was identified (Fig.

Title: Binding of DC-SIGN to the Hemagglutinin of Influenza A Viruses Supports Virus Replication in DC-SIGN Expressing Cells 
Summary: Indeed for most viruses tested, the presence of DC-SIGN mediated virus entry and infection of the cells which can be explained by binding of DC-SIGN to glycans on the HA of these viruses, followed by endocytosis of the virus and fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, the initial steps in the virus replication cycle. Of interest, the viruses that displayed efficient DC-SIGN mediated infection in the absence of sialic acids, had relatively large number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites on their HA In order to confirm that indeed the interaction between DC-SIGN and glycans on HA are at the basis of the observed increased infection percentages in DC-SIGN expressing cells, we used genetically modified influenza A/H1N1 viruses, A/Netherlands/26/07 and A/Netherlands/602/09 (H1N1pdm09), of which N-linked glycosylation sites were reciprocally exchanged to produce viruses that gained or lost one or more putative Nlinked glycosylation sites.

Title: Viral Infection at High Magnification: 3D Electron Microscopy Methods to Analyze the Architecture of Infected Cells

Title: Isolation of a Novel Swine Influenza Virus from Oklahoma in 2011 Which Is Distantly Related to Human Influenza C Viruses 
Summary: The phylogenetic analyses, together with the observations of genomic structure, indicated that this novel virus is more closely related to influenza C than to other members of the Orthomyxoviridae family including influenza A and B viruses, and suggested that the virus could be considered a new subtype of influenza C virus, despite its divergence from human influenza C viruses, which is similar to the divergence between influenza A and B viruses. Despite a lack of compelling evidence of C/OK virus infection in humans, we suspect that the virus may infect and replicate in the human population because of the following reasons: First of all, the virus infects and transmits in ferrets, a surrogate for human influenza pathogenesis studies.

Title: Current and Novel Approaches in Influenza Management 
Summary: Another universal vaccine candidate currently undergoing phase III clinical trials is based on Escherichia coli-expressed artificial recombinant protein consisting the concatenation of nine linear epitopes (five of which are specific to HA; three, to NP and one, to M1) of several influenza virus strains, and this vaccine has been shown to induce both cellular and humoral immunity in mice and it is envisaged as able to overcome high virus mutation rates [58] . In summary, T-705 is effective against influenza viruses in group 1 such as H1N1pdm09, H5N1 and group 2 such as H7N9 and also drug-resistant strains of these viruses and has been exploited for the treatment against other viruses e.g., Ebola virus [110] , and to date, no known resistance has been reported, except for a purposeful mutation that conferred resistance to a laboratory H1N1pdm09 virus strain [111] Efficacy of T-705 for treatment of influenza has thus warranted its advancement through phase III and II trials in Japan and US respectively [112] .

Moreover, the effect of type I IFN against HPeV1 was inconsistent between A549 and T84 cells in that type I IFN pretreatment inhibited HPeV1 infection in A549 but not T84 cells perhaps because of the lower sensitivity of type I IFN signaling in T84 cells.

Title: Expression and Cleavage of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus nsp3-4 Polyprotein Induce the Formation of Double-Membrane Vesicles That Mimic Those Associated with Coronaviral RNA Replication 
Summary: In summary, while the described differences between nsp3-4-expressing and MERS-CoV-infected cells suggest that other viral components may modulate the process of DMV formation and would be required to form the full array of membrane structures observed during infection, our results establish that MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 are sufficient to trigger all the membrane-remodeling steps required for inducing DMV formation, likely through the transformation of ER membranes into an RVN consisting of DMVs and modified ER. For MERS-CoV, coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 in 293T cells led to the formation of numerous circular double-membrane profiles together with some zippered ER (Fig.

Title: IFITM proteins are incorporated onto HIV-1 virion particles and negatively imprint their infectivity

To determine the intrinsic infectivity of viral particles produced in Jurkat cells treated as mentioned in the text, viral particles were retrieved at day 9 post infection to obtain sufficient amount of virus for our analysis, then viral preparations were normalized by exo-RT activity and used to challenge naïve HeLaP4 reporter cells.

Title: pharmaceutics Nanomaterials Designed for Antiviral Drug Delivery Transport across Biological Barriers 
Summary: The issue of estimating a general impact of viral infections involves several aspects that hinder this approach, namely: the variety of viral infections, the incidence of associated co-morbidities, social and psychological issues having economic repercussions (hidden costs), the variety of treatments (only direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and vaccinations can be used in the evaluation) and the presence of negative externalities [2] , meaning that the disease consequences are not limited to their patients infected or potentially but also to the related families who may experience social distress as well. The possible mechanism responsible for BBB disruption in HIV-1 encephalitis is considered a "Trojan horse" mechanism, where HIV infects specific T-lymphocytes and circulating monocytes, then entering to CNS through BBB gaps and followed by inflammatory reactions [111] , but, in the last years nanotechnology has been intensely explored and several experimental attempts have been carried out in order to enhance the BBB permeability toward antiretroviral drugs, briefly described below based on the nano-based formulation composition, since it is well known that the size and surface functionalization influence transport properties within tissues: • polymeric polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles with two incorporeated antiretroviral drugs (AZT and lamivudine) showed a 8-20 and 10-18 fold increase in BBB permeation, by three possible mechanisms as presented by the authors: prolonged interaction interval between drug-loaded nanoparticles and brain-microvascular endothelial cells elevated the concentration gradient between blood and the brain, Polysorbate 80 covering on the periphery of nanoparticles was able to be absorbed and degraded nanoparticles improved drug absorption [112] ; • spherical transferrin coated-PEGylated albumin nanoparticles encapsulating AZT prepared by ultra-emulsification method using chemical cross-linking by glutaraldehyde gained an access across the BBB through the transferrin receptor mediated endocytosis on the membrane [113] ; • transferrin-conjugated quantum rod nanoparticles conjugated with saquinavir crossed an in vitro BBB model by exploiting a receptor-mediated transport [114] ; • magnetic liposomal nanoformulations of azidothymidine 5 -triphosphate (the active form of azidothymidine) migrate across BBB in vitro, either directly or by a monocyte-mediated transport, under the influence of an external magnetic field [115] ; • novel nanodrug consisting of an iron oxide nanoparticle coated with PMA amphiphilic polymer and functionalized with the antiretroviral peptide enfuvirtide crossed the BBB by a passive diffusion, probably mediated by the absorption of the amphiphilic coating on the cell membrane [116] .

In addition, we found that, after HBV infection, the levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells, in which TMEM2 was overexpressed, were significantly lower than those in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, respectively.

Title: Extensive coronavirus-induced membrane rearrangements are not a determinant of pathogenicity OPEN 
Summary: When the same calculations were performed for Beau-R and M41 infected CK cells, similar results were found with 40% Beau-R infected cell sections containing at least 1 spherule and only 9% M41 infected cell These data indicate that the low spherule phenotype of M41 is characteristic of this viral strain and is not dependent on cell type as comparable observations were made between infection of primary CK cells and ex vivo TOCs. Samples were categorised into TOCs infected with either apathogenic IBV or pathogenic IBV (excluding M41) and CK cells infected with Beau-R. Data on the number of virus-induced features per cell was used to look for linkages between production of coronavirus DMVs, spherules, convoluted membranes and intracellular virus particles, following the hypothesis that features that were spatially and temporally linked would be more likely to co-occur in ultrathin sections of randomly-oriented cells such as these.

Title: Structural basis of nectin-1 recognition by pseudorabies virus glycoprotein D Author summary 
Summary: The structure of PRV gD bound with swine nectin-1 Inspired by the high affinity between gD284 and nectin-1, we prepared the complex of this short form of PRV gD bound with the IgV-domain protein of the SW-nectin-1, and obtained a complex crystal that diffracts to 2.7 Å resolution. Nevertheless, several unique features at the PRV-gD/nectin-1 binding interface (e. g. a bulged α2' helix of PRV gD interacts with an adjusted CC' loop in nectin-1, an about 3.5-Å shift for PRV gD (relative to HSV gD) when bound to the receptor) suffice the PRV ligand to recognize nectin-1 using quite different gD residues from those of the HSV homologs.

Title: molecules The Roles of Direct Recognition by Animal Lectins in Antiviral Immunity and Viral Pathogenesis 
Summary: The CRDs of MBL multimers recognize carbohydrate patterns on the virus surface, and consequently, the binding of MBL and viral particles results in activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system. The interaction between lectins and viral glycoproteins may lead to the three following consequences: (1) lectins, such as MBL and SPs, function as pattern recognition molecules that bind a repertoire of viruses and activate antiviral immune responses; (2) lectins are employed as attachment factors that recruit viral particles to the cell membrane to enhance viral entry, e.g., some mammalian lectins (DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR and MPRs) or their homologs in arthropods (mosGCTLs); and (3) some intracellular lectins, such as calnexin and ERGIC-53, function as susceptibility factors associated with virus-encoded proteins to facilitate viral replication or assembly (please refer to Figures 1 and 4) .

However, given the high susceptibility of type I IFN receptor KO mice (which still have a type III IFN response) toward many neurotropic viruses (see Table 1 ) and the relatively low expression of the IFN- receptor in the CNS, we anticipate that the contribution of IFN- in the protection of the CNS against viral infection will be modest.

Title: Alphavirus Mutator Variants Present Host-Specific Defects and Attenuation in Mammalian and Insect Models 
Summary: Following transfection of mammalian BHK-21 cells, there were no significant differences in RNA synthesis ( Figure 6A ) or production of infectious virus ( Figure 6C) ; however, in mosquito C6/36 cells, there was a very marked defect in replication for the mutator variants, compared to wildtype virus or the antimutator 483Y strain ( Figure 6B ), that correlated with the significant reduction in progeny (P,0.01 for all mutators, one-way ANOVA; Figure 6D ). The lower titers of infectious progeny were not the result of accumulation of detrimental mutations as was observed for mutators in mammalian hosts; rather, there was a direct defect in genomic RNA synthesis in mosquito cells (Figure 4 and 6).

Summary: To this end, in all experimental setups, the following scenarios were investigated: 1. non-differentiated THP-1 cells were compared to differentiated cells; 2. the effects of statins on differentiated THP-1 cells were assessed; 3. rescue experiments were performed to reverse statin effects at different key steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway; 4. the effects of statins were compared to those of inhibitors of processes downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Most of the statin effects we observed were reversed by FPP and dolichol and were mimicked by tunicamycin; in contrast, direct inhibitors of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation were not as effective as the statins, indicating that the N-glycosylation pathway, rather than the isoprenylation pathway, is the predominant regulator of CD147.

Title: The phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase inhibitor apilimod blocks filoviral entry and infection 
Summary: The cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator, after which the medium was replaced with 40 μL of fresh growth medium containing 10% SCS. After demonstrating that apilimod has activity against both EBOV and MARV in several cell types, notably in human macrophages (Figs 1 and 2, Table 1 ), we demonstrated that, by working through PIKfyve, its primary mode of action is to block trafficking of EBOV particles to NPC1 + endolysosomes (Figs 3-9) , the site of EBOV fusion and entry [39] [40] [41] .

Title: Development of a recombinant replication- deficient rabies virus-based bivalent-vaccine against MERS-CoV and rabies virus and its humoral immunogenicity in mice 
Summary: To evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant viruses (RVΔP-MERS/S1 and RVΔP), mice were inoculated once or twice with RVΔP-MERS/S1 or RVΔP or twice with PBS (Fig 6a) , and titers of VNAs against MERS-CoV and RV were determined using sera from these mice (Fig 6b and 6c) . In conclusion, we found that intraperitoneal vaccination with RVΔP expressing the MERS-CoV S1 protein induced VNAs against MERS-CoV and RV in mice, suggesting RVΔP-MERS/ S1 as a promising bivalent-vaccine candidate against MERS and RV.

Title: Type I Interferon Receptor Deficiency in Dendritic Cells Facilitates Systemic Murine Norovirus Persistence Despite Enhanced Adaptive Immunity 
Summary: These data demonstrate that the adaptive immune response in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice, including both CD4 and CD8 T cells, is functional in an Ifnar1-sufficient environment in vivo and suggest that increased viral replication in Ifnar1-deficient cells is sufficient for establishing persistent viral replication despite a functional adaptive immune response. In the MNoV model of persistence studied here, we observed that increased viral replication due to defects in the type I IFN pathway is linked to viral persistence: Ifnar -/mice have high early viral replication and succumb to infection; Irf3x7 -/mice have marginally lower peak viral replication [17] and allow CW3 to persist; lineage specific deletion of Ifnar1 in CD11c or LysM expressing cells also results in less viral replication than Ifnar -/- [17] but allows MNoV persistence; Ifih1 -/mice have small increases in viral replication [31] but are able to clear the infection; lineage specific deletion of Ifnar1 in Villin-expressing cells leads to no change in viral titer and clearance.

Summary: TnF Blockade regulates il-10 expression in human cD4 + and cD8 + T cells To investigate whether TNF blockade regulates IL-10 expression in different pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing CD4 + T cells, we isolated CD4 + T cells from PB of healthy donors and cocultured the cells with CD14 + monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the anti-TNF mAb adalimumab (1 µg/ml), as previously described (20) . Contrary to the effects of TNF blockade, addition of rhTNFα to cocultures of CD4 + CD45RO + T cells, monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb led to a striking decrease in the percentage of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells and within IL-17 + , IFNγ + , and TNFα + CD4 + T cell subsets (GM-CSF + and IL-4 + CD4 + T cells were not tested) ( Figure 1C ).

Title: Lipid-Based Particles: versatile Delivery Systems for Mucosal vaccination against infection 
Summary: However, the quest for mucosal vaccines is challenging due to (1) the fact that Ag sampling has to be performed across the epithelium through a relatively limited number of portals of entry; (2) the deleterious acidic and proteolytic environment of the mucosae that affect the stability, integrity, and retention time of the applied Ags; and (3) the tolerogenic environment of mucosae, which requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit efficient effector immune responses. Identifying the most adequate vaccine formulation deliverable mucosally remains challenging due to (1) the fact that, in contrast to parenteral vaccination where injected Ags and adjuvants are directly in contact with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), Ag sampling has to be performed across the mucus and the epithelium first; (2) the deleterious acidic, proteolytic, and dynamic environment of the mucosal surfaces which impact the stability, integrity, and retention time of the applied Ags; and (3) the tolerogenic nature of the mucosa, which impairs induction of effector immunity to antigenic entities lacking sufficient immunostimulatory signals (12) .

It is perhaps even likely that part of the mRNA encoding this nascent peptide signal also functions as a recoding signal at the mRNA level in the mRNA exit channel and while it appears that the identity of the nts immediately 5 of the shift site are important at the mRNA level, effects at the amino acid level may in addition be relevant (466) .

Summary: It has been reported to induce autophagy via histone deacetylation and p53 activation in cancer cells [64] , and can elicit the upregulation of Beclin 1, LC3-I, and LC3-II, as well as the inhibition of mTOR in an ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) model [65, 66] . In PEL cells, ROS induced by EGCG results in an increase in autophagic activation via the upregulation of Beclin 1 expression, leading to the inhibition of HHV8 replication.

Intracerebral wt RVFV inoculation of 50 pfu into 10-week-old gerbils resulted in an efficient viral replication (~10 7 pfu/g) in the brain and the mean time to death was six days, which is not statistically different from that of 4-week-old gerbils, which may indicate the presence of host factors influencing the neuroinvasiveness in an age-dependent manner [68] .

Title: Inhibition of Hepatitis E Virus Spread by the Natural Compound Silvestrol 
Summary: In the case of silvestrol-treated cells, however, a significant reduction of MVP in the cytoplasm was observed for the HEV-positive cells (H+), leading to an amount of MVP that is comparable to the amount of silvestrol treated HEV-negative cells (D+). In accordance to the observed withdrawal of MVP from the cytoplasm, resulting in the loss of its antiviral activity for cells that are treated with 10 nM silvestrol, the quantification of the immunofluorescence staining with the core-specific antiserum ( Figure 8E ,F) shows no significant reduction in the number of HEV positive cells for 10 nM silvestrol, which stands in contrast to the significant reduction that was observed for 2 nM and 50 nM treated cells ( Figure 5B,C) .

Title: Access to 
Summary: As discussed below, the major Alzheimer's disease genes implicated by the recent GWAS data, as well as APP and gamma secretase, and previous GWAS results are majoritarily involved in pathogen entry and defence, particularly in relation to herpes simplex, but also to other relevant pathogens, and in the immune network. The antimicrobial and immunostimulant effects of betaamyloid, the cleavage of a number of pathogen receptors by gamma secretase, and the concentration of both APP and gamma-secretase components in dendritic cells suggest that a major function of this key group, implicated in both familial and late onset Alzheimer's disease, is dedicated to pathogen defence, and that increased beta-amyloid generation is primarily a defence mechanism to rid the body (and brain) of invading pathogens: This scenario is supported by the ability of herpes simplex, C. pneumoniae, and B. burgdorferi to increase beta-amyloid deposition [234] [235] [236] .

Summary: In this review, recent progress of canonical or non-canonical activation JAK/STAT pathway, viral antagonism of the JAK/ STAT pathway, removing of the JAK/STAT antagonist from viral genome for virus attenuation, and the potential pathogenesis roles of tyrosine phosphorylation-independent non-canonical STATs activation during virus infection are discussed in detail to provide new insight to understand the interplay between JAK/ STAT signaling and viral antagonism. In addition to STAT1 and STAT2, the other STATs activated by type I IFNs can be inhibited by virus infection, which has been less investigated; the role of other STATs in the IFN-mediated response still requires further investigation.

The lack of any negative effect of the 4KR mutations on virus growth in mammalian cells or virulence in mice suggested that perhaps the lysine residues in NSs could be important for a role during infection of the mosquito vector.

Title: Interleukin 35: a key mediator of suppression and the propagation of infectious tolerance 
Summary: While in vitro studies have clearly shown that IL-35 is able to directly act on effector T cells (supported by the expression profiles of the IL-35 receptor subunits), the ability of IL-35 to suppress antibody responses could suggest that IL-35 is also able to act on other cell populations, though it could also be a reflection of the inhibition of helper T cell responses that contribute to humoral immunity. When these mice were examined further for the impact of IL-35 on Treg function, they found that administration of IL-35 led to an increase in the frequency of CD4+CD39+ Tregs that expressed Foxp3 and IL-10, and that IL-35 promoted the proliferation of these T cells (34).

Summary: In accordance with the mRNA data, the release of IL-1β, -6, -8 and TNF-α from HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant derived from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells was comparatively much higher than those treated with mock-infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant after 24 and 48 h as measured by ELISA (p < 0.05, Figure 6 ). Here we demonstrate that (i) WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells are one of the potential sources of inflammatory cytokines, (ii) WNV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to SK-N-SH cell death and glial cells activation, and (iii) WNV-induced SK-N-SH cell death can be protected in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1β and TNF-α.

Together, these results strongly suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis is mediated by upregulation of DR6 expression via activation of PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor CREB, which controls the expression of DR6.

Title: The Evolution of Poxvirus Vaccines 
Summary: In fact, scientific concepts as relevant as the basis of immunology and antibody responses to virus infection, the components of a virus particle (DNA, protein, lipids), the presence of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the virion machinery for mRNA synthesis and modifications at the 3'-end and 5'-end, the formation of two forms of infectious virus particles, the existence of multiple viral genes with the capacity to counteract host immune responses, and the ability of the virus to accept the insertion of heterologous foreign genes in the viral genome or the removal of multiple viral genes, are among features that define the plasticity of this family of viruses, which in turn increased our knowledge of living viruses and cells. The most widely used poxvirus vectors are derived from MVA, NYVAC and ALVAC, and while none of these vectors has been approved for human usage as a virus recombinant vaccine, the promising results obtained in a large number of preclinical and clinical trials presage a not-too-distant application of these recombinant viral vectors as vaccines in humans against multiple diseases.

Title: Proteomic Profiling of the TRAF3 Interactome Network Reveals a New Role for the ER-to-Golgi Transport Compartments in Innate Immunity 
Summary: From these results we hypothesized that the localization of TRAF3 to the ER-to-Golgi compartment and the Golgi fragmentation of the latter into punctate structures might be required for the proper positioning of TRAF3 with MAVS. Indeed, the following findings suggests a role for Sec16A and p115 in the TRAF3-mediated RLH type I IFN response: (1) Sec16A and p115 are found in immunocomplexes containing TRAF3, but not TRAF2 or TRAF6; (2) inactivation of TRAF3 by deletion of its Nterminal RING finger domain and the C-terminal TRAF domain displaces TRAF3 from the ER-Golgi transport compartments; (3) in non-treated cells, TRAF3 colocalizes and tightly associates with p115, Sec16A, ERGIC53 and GM130, markers of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular compartment; (4) activation of the RLH pathway leads to reorganization of the Golgi apparatus into punctate structures containing TRAF3 and GM130; (5) an increased association between TRAF3, Sec16A, p115 and TBK1 is observed in virally-infected, dsRNA-and dsDNA-transfected cells; (6) mild overexpression of both proteins enhances SeV-, TBK1-and MAVS-stimulated IFNb, ISG56 and NF-kB promoter induction; (7) knocking down the expression level of p115 or Sec16A affects the cellular distribution of TRAF3, impairs its capacity to associate with MAVS and diminishes the type I IFN response following poly I:C or polydA:dT transfection and SeV infection; and (8) enforced retention of TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi compartment by the addition of a COPI and COP II sorting signal peptide impairs TRAF3 recruitment to the cis-Golgi and diminishes the type I IFN response.

In an effort to directly demonstrate that airway protease mediated virus entry enhancement is due to the presence of cleavage site on the SARS spike glycoprotein, 16HBE cells were pre-incubated with wild-type (SARS-CoVpp) or mutant (R667App) pseudotypes on ice, which allowed virus attachment but not entry.

Our results thus demonstrate that IFITM3 restricts the IAV fusion at a post-hemifusion step, most likely at the point of fusion pore opening, as evidenced by the dramatic decrease of the BlaM signal in A549 and MDCK cells expressing this protein (Fig.

Failure of our analysis to detect some of these proteins does not challenge their potential role in VSV replication, as these proteins may be present within the virions but were not detectable in our MS analysis, or, in the case of the protein interactions shown outside the virion, the described interactions may be transient.

Title: Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Defenses against Bacterial Pore-Forming Toxin In Vivo 
Summary: Specifically, we find that bacterial pore-forming toxins (PFTs) activate the ire-1-xbp-1 branch of the ER Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in C. elegans and mammalian cells and that the ire-1-xbp-1 and atf-6, but not the pek-1, branches of the UPR are important for C. elegans cellular defenses against a PFT since elimination of either of these two branches leads to hypersensitivity to the PFT Cry5B. Third, the activation and function of the UPR in PFT defenses can be separated from the role of the UPR in dealing with unfolded proteins (here tested using the drug tunicamycin) in two ways: 1) the relative importance of the various arms of the UPR for defense against PFT is different than their importance for protection against unfolded proteins and 2) the activation of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway by PFT, but not unfolded proteins, requires p38 MAPK (see below).

With regard to this, viral factors can be classified into one of the four following subgroups: proapoptotic proteins (1) that insert into mitochondrial membranes and hence trigger MMP through the action of amphipathic a-helical domains or (2) that promote MMP indirectly, through the activition of host-encoded factors (Table 1) , and antiapoptotic modulators (3) that exhibit sequence and/or structural similarity to multidomain BH1-4 members of the Bcl-2 family (so-called viral Bcl-2 proteins [vBcl-2s]) or (4) that inhibit apoptosis via other mechanisms (Table 2) .

The remarkable similarities in both the pre-and postfusion forms of the fusion proteins of SFV E1, an Alphavirus, and DEN and TBEV, members of the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviruses, in the absence of detectable sequence similarities, suggest that Alphavirus and Flavivirus class II fusion proteins may have diverged from a common progenitor.

Summary: GPI-scFv (X5) exhibits remarkable degree of breadth and potency against HIV-1 Next, we compared CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 expression in the secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced TZM.bl cells and found that there is no significant difference in their expression compared to mock-transduced TZM.bl cells, suggesting that the expression of transgenes does not alter the expression of the receptor and the coreceptors for HIV-1 in the transduced cells (Additional File 2). To evaluate the effect of GPI-scFv (X5) on HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, the GPI-scFv (X5 and AB65)-transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were co-cultured with 69TiRevEnv cells as previously described [44] .

Title: Nucleocapsid Interacts with NPM1 and Protects it from Proteolytic Cleavage, Enhancing Cell Survival, and is Involved in PEDV Growth OPEN 
Summary: Our research group has shown that the PEDV N protein localizes not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleolus in infected cells and cells expressing the N protein alone 15 ; however, the factors that determine the nucleolar localization of PEDV N protein and the effect of this localization on virus replication are not clearly understood. To examine the co-localization of N protein with NPM1, Vero E6 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing AcGFP-N and DsRed-NPM1 proteins, and the subcellular localization of N protein and NPM1 was examined by confocal microscopy (Fig.

Title: Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology The role of interleukin-12 in the heavy metal-elicited immunomodulation: relevance of various evaluation methods 
Summary: The results demonstrate that following exposure to Cd for 5 weeks, the levels of IL-12p70 were positively correlated to the up-or down-regulation of the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), which was in turn negatively correlated to the Th2 cytokines IL-4 (r value = -0.74, p < 0.01) and IL-5 (r value= -0.61, p < 0.01); data not shown. Although the increase in IL-12p70 serum profile of mice exposed for 3 weeks to Cd was not significant in comparison to control mice, exposure to Cd for 5 weeks significantly increased the levels of serum IFN-γ that coincided with the increase in IL-12p70 levels.

Summary: Our results have shown that, in fish, the expression levels of some of the most commonly used 'housekeeping' genes are, in fact, regulated by estrogen treatment, and based on the data presented, we therefore recommend against the use of ef1a, g6pd, bactin, and gapdh as internal controls in real-time PCR studies of estrogen-exposed fish. To determine the effect of using the different 'housekeeping' genes on normalized data for genes of interest, the liver cDNA samples from the EE 2 exposure which had not been normalized to contain equal cDNA concentrations were analysed by real-time PCR (as described above) for the expression of the two estrogen-regulated genes of interest vtg, an estrogen-upregulated gene [32, 53] , and cyp1a, an estrogen-downregulated gene [54] , in parallel with expression analyses of the eight candidate 'housekeeping' genes.

Title: Regional genetic diversity for NNV grouper viruses across the Indo- Asian region -implications for selecting virus resistance in farmed groupers OPEN 
Summary: The goal of this report was to collate the most comprehensive data set to date on NNV RNA2 sequences for warm water Asian marine finfish, whether published and/or lodged in Genbank over the last 20 years, including some sequence data produced by our group for Vietnamese and Taiwanese grouper, to statistically test the data for evidence of NNV strain variation that associates with geography, host species and year and also to determine whether there are "characteristic attributes" that indicate regional (or host, year) specific differences among the strains. Considering the new RNA sequences generated in this report, each of the RNA2 sequences from three humpback grouper in Vietnam, sampled at the same time from the same hatchery, were all 100% identical.

Summary: Thus, our primary objective was to estimate the TD-R values for PRRSV using regional and system-level PRRS data from across the US, and to contrast it to incidence estimates and commonly investigated space-time clusters. Interestingly, when comparing raw number of new cases or incidence with the TD-R estimates, all statistically significant peaks of TD-R (P < 0.05) preceded a meaningful increase in the number of cases (>2) for the regions of SE and S, showing the potential the tool has for early signaling outbreaks (Figure 2) .

Title: Food and Drug Administration 
Summary: Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this bat capsid sequence likely represents a novel calicivirus that is most closely related to non-human caliciviruses, such as lagoviruses and Љrecoviruses.Љ We used VLPs from the newly identified bat calicivirus and BtNoV to assess their potential carbohydrate patterns in comparison with those of human noroviruses. The bat caliciviruses exhibited different binding patterns: the BtCalV/A10 VLPs strongly bound H type 3, A, and B antigens, with limited binding to H type 1 and ␣-2,6-sialic acids, while the BtNoV VLPs strongly bound ␣-2,6-sialic acid, with moderate binding to H type 1 and H type 3, A, and B HBGAs, suggesting that bat caliciviruses can bind to a range of host receptors and offer multiple routes for cross-species transmission.

Title: The Time Required to Estimate the Case Fatality Ratio of Influenza Using Only the Tip of an Iceberg: Joint Estimation of the Virulence and the Transmission Potential 
Summary: Assuming that the conditional probability density function of the time from infection to death f (s) is known, the number of deaths d(t) is modeled as which can be rewritten as where M(−r) represents the moment-generating function of the time from infection to death given the exponential growth rate r. One may integrate both sides and use the cumulative number of deaths by day t, D(t) for the estimation of CFR. Then the confirmed cases among subgroup s c s (t) are Since the observed dataset is discrete time series, that is, daily data, we integrate the confirmed cases as follows: Assuming that the conditional probability density function of the time from infection to death, f (s) is known and is shared among subgroups, the number of new deaths of subgroup s at time t d s (t) is described as which is rewritten as (14) As was integrated in the homogeneous case, one may focus on the cumulative number of deaths D s (T) by the latest time of observation T. The estimator of the group-specific CFR is given by The likelihood function to estimate the next-generation matrix may partially account for stochastic dependence structure of the transmission dynamics, and thus, conditions for every future expectation on the past history of the epidemic.

Summary: Our results showed a marked variety of gene expression profiles in the PBMCs of EV71-infected rhesus infants during the pathogenic process, and these profiles were characterized by the activation of the integral functions of the immune system, as well as the up-regulation of genes associated with the inflammatory response. On the basis of these results and findings from the CNS and lungs that suffered inflammatory pathological injuries, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays were performed to detect the expression of substance P in the CNS and lung tissues from EV71infected rhesus infants at 4, 7, and 10 days p.i.. qRT-PCR analyses showed that the TAC1 gene was up-regulated 18-, 12-and 9-fold in the CNS on days 4, 7 and 10 days p.i., respective to noninfected controls (Fig.

Title: Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children 
Summary: The cases were categorised into three distinct groups based on probable pneumonia aetiology: (a) definite bacterial cases: cases with clinical empyema or with at least one putative bacterial pathogen detected in blood or pleural fluid by culture or PCR (regardless of the detection of respiratory viruses in NPS); (b) presumed viral cases: cases without empyema or bacteria detected in blood/ pleural fluid, and with at least one respiratory virus detected in NPS (with or without bacteria detected in the NPS); (c) other pneumonia cases: cases fulfilling neither of the criteria for definite bacterial or presumed viral (with or without bacteria detected in NPS). CRP, WCC and ANC were higher in definite bacterial pneumonia and the CRP had value for distinguishing these from presumed viral and other pneumonias.

Summary: Studies focusing on obstacles to electronic access to and use of evidence-based information in the PH field [1] [2] [3] 5, [10] [11] [12] [13] have identified many relevant obstacles including: (1) limited awareness of the importance of evidence-based information to inform practice and lack of encouragement from opinion leaders to seek it; (2) limited awareness of what information is available electronically and from what sources; (3) limited access to computers, the Internet or email; (4) limited skills needed to access the information sources and lack of ease of use; (5) a diverse array of content needs requiring access to databases from many disciplines (and in other languages); (6) limited time to sift through the poorly filtered information that is returned by searches using sets of search terms inadequate for PH concerns; (7) limited ability of decision-makers to appraise the methodological quality of research; and (8) the paucity of systematic reviews of PH topics. We have used the insights gained from the study to inform the construction of an extended classification of the types of information needed by PH professionals and of a hypothetical model for PH information access that could meet their needs for access to diverse credible sources.

Summary: • Strategies to consider include development of a more precise system to risk stratify geographic settings susceptible to disease outbreaks, reconsideration of the 2005 International Health Regulations Criteria to allow for earlier responses to localized epidemics before they reach epidemic proportions, increasing the flexibility of the World Health Organization director general to characterize epidemics with more granularity, development of guidelines for best practices to promote partnership with local stakeholders and identify locally acceptable response strategies, and, most importantly, making good on international commitments to establish a fund for public health emergency preparedness and response. While current efforts to bring the EVD epidemic under control should be widely applauded, the delayed response during the early stages of the EVD epidemic in West Africa exemplifies not only the danger posed by disease outbreaks in states with weak health systems but also their widespread impact in an increasingly globalized world.

Title: Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates containing the amide bond 
Summary: Replacement of the P-CH 2 -O-CHR-fragment in ANPs (e.g., acyclovir, tenofovir) by the P-CH 2 -HN-C(O)residue was introduced to study the influence of a linker rigidity and changes in donor-acceptor properties. To elaborate an appropriate synthetic methodology, a series of the 36 respective phosphonates as O,O-diethyl esters was prepared in good yields by the EDC-induced coupling of the straight chain x-aminophosphonates and nucleobasederived acetic acids.

A lower prevalence of IL-10-producing CD8 cells, which at the same time produce more of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, could lead to a more prominent pro-inflammatory and cytolytic response with decreased auto-regulatory IL-10 production in CD8 cells in NAIS in the first 72 h. Another interpretation could be that the decreased level of IL-10 production by CD8+ cells reflects an in utero inflammatory response that decreases by the time of birth.

Title: Redox process is crucial for inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid against activity of YopH: virulence factor of Yersinia pestis 
Summary: The value of the current obtained for ATA at a concentration of 4.9 · 10 -4 M measured in DMSO solution is comparable to the hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 1.5 · 10 −3 M performed for potentials from 1.25 V to 2.5 V. This may indicate that the hydrogen peroxide could be present during the redox process of ATA. ATA loses the inhibitory properties against PTPs in the presence of catalase, which shows that the mechanism of ATA induced inactivation of YopH is probably involved with the oxidation of catalytic cysteine in an active site.

Title: Teacher led school-based surveillance can allow accurate tracking of emerging infectious diseases -evidence from serial cross-sectional surveys of febrile respiratory illness during the H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic in Singapore 
Summary: The study included several clinic-based indicators of influenza activity (see Table 1 ), analyzed by the relevant age strata (7 to 12, and 13 to 16 years for primary and secondary school-age children respectively): -Influenza-like illness reporting from sentinel general practitioners (GP-ILI) -Proportion of influenza-like illness samples from primary care clinics testing positive by PCR (Lab-ILI) against which the following school-based indicators could be compared: -Notifications of laboratory confirmed cases of pdmH1N1 by school (Sch-LCC) -Students with fever detected by a system of twice daily temperature monitoring in all schools (Sch-DTM) -Self-reported febrile respiratory illness in 6 sentinel schools (Sch-FRI) Finally, cross-sectional serological surveys were used to estimate the amount of pdmH1N1 infection in school-aged children. For Sch-FRI, we also derived an adjusted estimate (Sch-FRI-adj) where we attempted to remove possible contribution from non-pdmH1N1 causes by subtracting the FRI incidence in week 38; week 38 was used as a proxy for baseline FRI incidence since data for 5 of the 6 schools was still available for that week, and the proportion of ILI testing positive for pdmH1N1 had stabilized at about 20% by then.

Title: A Novel Psittacine Adenovirus Identified During an Outbreak of Avian Chlamydiosis and Human Psittacosis: Zoonosis Associated with Virus-Bacterium Coinfection in Birds 
Summary: Since there was a positive correlation between the adenovirus viral load and C. psittaci bacterial load in the lungs of the infected Mealy parrots and because adenoviruses are known to cause immunosuppression in birds, we speculate that our novel Psittacine adenovirus may have caused immunosuppression among infected parrots resulting in a larger number of Mealy Parrots being infected by C. psittaci with a higher bacterial load, leading to a greater chance of zoonotic transmission to humans. Our investigation suggested that the novel Psittacine adenovirus may have been associated with immunosuppression among infected birds, leading to higher C. psittaci bacterial loads in the lungs of psittacine birds, and hence increasing the risk of infection in exposed humans.

Title: Moving interdisciplinary science forward: integrating participatory modelling with mathematical modelling of zoonotic disease in Africa 
Summary: The participatory methods and techniques which were used are outlined in this section as well as the usefulness of participatory research for integrative modelling, first with a diagram illustrating how it can be utilised, followed by case study examples and the findings of this research and how it contributed to other modelling approaches. For example, in Zambia in relation to modelling daily activity patterns it was possible through participatory research to capture the types of activities undertaken by the different roles held within households, to capture the range of typical destinations and obtain a sense of the frequency and timing of visits (more specification of the model than estimation of parameters).

Title: TRiM25 in the Regulation of the Antiviral innate immunity 
Summary: Although it has been reported that RIPLET can mediate K63 polyubiquitination of K172 in the CARD domain of RIG-I (67), it does not seem that TRIM25 and RIPLET play a redundant role in the activation of RIG-I, since RIPLET mainly generates K63 ubiquitin chains in the RIG-I C-terminal regulatory domain (68, 69) . For example, TRIM4, which belong to the same subgroup as TRIM25 in the TRIM protein family and share with it similar structural characteristics, can also target RIG-I for K63 polyubiquitination in K154, K164, and K172 of its CARD domain, which results in the activation IRF3 and NF-κB, and IFN-β production (70) .

Title: Virus survey in populations of two subspecies of bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae bassanii and oceanensis) in south-eastern Australia reveals a high prevalence of diverse herpesviruses 
Summary: The aim of this study was to characterise the virus diversity of the two subspecies to investigate the possibility of viral disease contributing to the decline of the southern bent-winged bat by comparing viruses detected in southern bent-winged bats with those from the more common eastern bent-winged bats. Two herpesviruses (CH6-like and E22-like) were detected only in eastern bent-winged bats, whilst another herpesvirus (N7050-like) was detected only in southern bent-winged bats, raising the possibility that these viruses are specific for each of the sub-species of bent-winged bats, although this requires further investigation with larger numbers of animals and samples collected over different times of the year.

Title: Archaeal DnaG contains a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain and enables tailing of rRNA by the exosome 
Summary: To see whether the RNA binding activity of DnaG is important for the positive influence of DnaG on the polyadenylation of the 3 16S rRNA transcript by the exosome, DnaG-E175Q and DnaG-K6AY7A were used in the assays instead of wild-type DnaG. Binding of RNA by DnaG is important for the observed faster degradation of poly(rA) 30 (Figure 7) and is a prerequisite for the polyadenylation of rRNA and rRNA-derived transcripts by the DnaG-containing exosome in vitro (Figure 8) .

Title: Prioritizing zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia using a one health approach 
Summary: To facilitate inter-sectoral collaboration and effectively address the impact of the prioritized zoonotic diseases, workshop participants recommended the following next steps: 1) establish a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit with representation from the animal and human health agencies, 2) develop a national strategy to jointly address the five prioritized zoonotic diseases, which could be one of the primary tasks for the joint Zoonotic Disease Unit, 3) engage leadership across different ministries to support the One Health program platform and assist in coordination of the prioritized zoonotic diseases, 4) strengthen veterinary public health workforce development in collaboration with the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, and 5) the prioritized disease list should be reviewed every 2-5 years in order to address new emerging zoonotic disease threats and incorporate knowledge acquired through enhanced surveillance and laboratory diagnostics. The final disease ranking may have been impacted by the lack of data such that diseases not present in the published literature were not known to be present in Ethiopia and therefore, received lower scores than diseases that are known to be present in the country.

Title: A Three-Stemmed mRNA Pseudoknot in the SARS Coronavirus Frameshift Signal 
Summary: To address the question of whether the potential to form a three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is unique to the SARS-CoV, we searched for such structures in all of the known viral À1 PRF signals listed in the RECODE 2003 database [15] , as well as the putative frameshift signals in all of the sequenced members of the Order Nidovirales (including coronaviruses and arteriviruses). Similar to the effects observed in stem 2, the presence of compensatory mutations in construct S3B did not rescue À1 PRF efficiency to near wild-type levels, again suggesting that both the general structure of stem 3 and specific sequences within it are required for maximal stimulation of À1 PRF.

The values of age-specific R for adults aged between 26 and 45 years kept at a high range from 2013 to 2016 and it could be attributed to the lower efficacy of measles vaccines, the low vaccination coverages during 1980s and earlier, and the reduced chance of natural infections.

Similarly, there is no demonstration of variations in host specificity among different viral strains, and no studies on host specificity are available; the recently demonstrated occurrence of natural reassortment among field isolates could have some implication in determining the host specificity and virulence of these viruses, and will probably be investigated in the future.

The partial nucleotide sequences of the G protein from a set of isolates, along with the recognition pattern by monoclonal antibodies against the BRSV G, F, N, and P proteins, showed random antigenic differences among the isolates, although cross-reactivity to the viral protein epitopes was observed, particularly with the F protein.

Title: GraphDNA: a Java program for graphical display of DNA composition analyses 
Summary: For example, since the coding strand of bacterial genomic DNA tends to be purine rich [6] and majority of genes are transcribed in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork there is asymmetric nucleotide composition along the genome such that the DNA composition may be used to predict the origin and termini of replication [7] [8] [9] . When large (>200 Kb) DNA sequences are loaded, the program automatically selects a window size of 70 nucleotides and permits the user to change that window size, this reduces the processing and display times; for example, the time required for loading and plotting the GC skews of two 20 Mb DNA sequences was approximately 2 minutes on a dual 2 GHz desktop computer; replotting this data with another nucleotide skew took <45 s. Additional features include: 1) the application can accept gapped multiple alignment files in FASTA format; this permits homologous regions of genomes to be kept in register and allows easier comparison of skews among several sequences.

Title: Social determinants of health inequalities: towards a theoretical perspective using systems science 
Summary: In applying the systems approach, a point of departure from the conventional model of thinking is to consider population health outcomes as one of many components of the human condition or the 'standard of living' of a population. If this metaphor is applied to SDHI, it illustrates the uniqueness of the context to a particular pattern of health outcomes in a population, and the theoretical possibility that widely divergent determinants lead to similar patterns of outcomes in different situations.

Summary: To investigate the conformation of site Ø and define the epitope on prefusion RSV F recognized by AM22, we determined the crystal structure of the AM22 Fab alone and in complex with the prefusion-stabilized RSV F variant DS-Cav1 [40] . The AM22 heavy chain buries 554 Å 2 (76%) on the surface of prefusion RSV F and is involved in 15 hydrogen bonds with RSV F, 14 of which are formed between the CDR H3 and seven residues within Gln202-Ser215 of α4 and the α4-α5 loop of prefusion RSV F. The light chain is responsible for the remaining 175 Å 2 (24%) of buried surface area on prefusion RSV F and forms three additional hydrogen bonds with the α4-α5 loop via the CDR L2.

Title: A road for a promising future for China's primates: The potential for restoration 
Summary: It is estimated that China has lost between 1.9 and 2.7 million km 2 of its original forest in the last 2 000 years (based on models of habitat suitability; Ahrends et al., 2017) ; this is an area approximately the size of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The synthesis of this information will be vital in determining the locations to be prioritized in restoration efforts; however, other local aspects, such as the willingness of the local population to participate in restoration and to not hunt primates must also be considered.

Title: Growth Patterns and Scaling Laws Governing AIDS Epidemic in Brazilian Cities 
Summary: The current status of the AIDS infection in Brazil is depicted in Figure 1 , where the size of the circles is proportional to the logarithm of y i,t and the histograms along the axis detail the annual absolute frequencies as function of the geographic position of the cities. In the present work, we showed that the AIDS epidemic in Brazil (1980-2012) exhibits the following growth patterns: (i) logistic-type growth of total AIDS cases per year with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading and (ii) power law-type decaying of the actual reproduction number; (iii) power law behavior with a robust exponent in the PDF of the annual absolute frequency among cities; (iv) a robust allometric relationship between the epidemic and the population of the cities; and, finally, (v) different profile for the temporal evolution of the epidemics depending on the average absolute frequency of cases in the cities.

Title: K-Pax2: Bayesian identification of cluster-defining amino acid positions in large sequence datasets 
Summary: The sequence locations of such changes, the number of groups K and the explicit assignment of strains into the groups are all unknown parameters of our model to be inferred from the matrix X. Non-synonymous changes in viral strains that are free from diversifying selection pressure will fluctuate in frequency in the population due to drift, but they are not in general expected to be rapidly driven to fixation unless they are tightly linked to other sites that are under selection. In addition, more rigid probabilistic restrictions must be imposed on the model structure to ensure that the grouping W and the identities of the selected sites become jointly identifiable and convey a biologically meaningful extraction of information from the alignment S. Note that residues that remain unchanged in the whole virus population over long periods of time ostensibly due to strict functional constraints on the protein structure are also uninformative for the purpose of identification of sequence clusters, as they correspond to fully conserved sites in the alignment S. Under relatively strong selection pressure, non-synonymous changes that are associated with an increase in fitness should rapidly rise in frequency, leading to the formation of a novel group of strains.

Summary: In this study, we produced glycyrrhetinic acid using the metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae by introducing the entire heterogeneous biosynthetic pathway of GA. With the overexpression of ERG20, ERG9, ERG1 and tHMG1, we were able to improve GA production by approximately 21%, although this was lower than reported in previous studies. This suggests that the improved metabolic flux in the MVA pathway of strain Y2 by the integration of ERG20-ERG9, ERG1 and tHMG1 were likely directed to the sterol synthesis, and partially to GA synthesis.

Summary: The LSQ superposition of 229E-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro shows that the overall architectures of both the 229E-3CL pro and PEDV-3CL pro active sites in their unbound states are structurally very similar, and the active site residues of the catalytic dyad, residues Cys144 and His41 in both PEDV-3CL pro and 229E-3CL pro , are located in almost identical structural space within the active site cavity, which is solvent exposed on one side (Fig. Interestingly, in both the superimpositions of PEDV-3CL pro with 229E-3CL pro and FIPV-3CL pro , the loops comprising the protease subsites of the 3CL pro active site are in nearly identical structural locations, with the exception of the loop that comprises the S 2 subsite, the S 2 loop.

Title: Presence of Vaccine-Derived Newcastle Disease Viruses in Wild Birds a11111 
Summary: Although our data do not allow for the identification of the direct sources of NDV infection for the studied wild birds, it is reasonable to suggest that these wild bird isolates originated from recent spillovers of live NDV vaccines, instead of representing strains that naturally circulate in these birds for the following reasons: i) if the newly isolated viruses had been naturally circulating and originated from vaccine [70] . The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be strains (originally isolated in the 1940s and the 1960s) through natural evolution they would have changed significantly for the last 4 to 6 decades and would have presented much higher nucleotide distances than the ones determined in the pairwise distance analysis (S7, S8 and S9 Tables); ii) preservation of live NDV in the environment, unchanged for such a long period of time, is highly unlikely due to the thermal and biological lability of NDV [83] ; and iii) for the majority of the isolates studied here that are almost genetically identical, there is no evidence of a direct epidemiological link, neither geographical nor temporal, between their isolations.

Title: Structural and Functional Properties of the Hepatitis C Virus p7 Viroporin 
Summary: This different positioning of the helical elements between p7 proteins of different Gts and a more extended arrangement of the monomer within the assembled channel revealed unexpected features when compared with models of Gt1b p7 such as the lack of an unstructured loop connecting the two transmembrane regions or a C-terminal region that is embedded into the lipid bilayer ( Figure 2B ). Although some of these mutations are associated with delayed cleavage of the E2-p7-NS2 precursor (e.g., RR33/35 in Gt2a and KR33/35 in Gt1b and 1a) or E2 degradation (e.g., RGR33-35/AAA), which might account for impaired virus production, recent studies have now confirmed the importance of the basic residues for p7 ion channel activity and point to a direct link between the proton channel activity of p7 and production of HCV infectious particles [20, 33, 63] .

Summary: This paper is aimed at addressing some of the major questions that are frequently asked when faced with ETEC enteric neonatal and post-weaning colibacillosis in the field, which are the main subjects of this review, concerning the diagnostic approach and the interpretation of the specific investigations, the measures of control based on antibiotic therapy and the impact of antimicrobial resistance in the control of these diseases. The development of resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial drugs, as well as the demonstrated trend of resistance in ETEC strains to the antibiotics used for the treatment of colibacillosis in pigs, is nowadays a reason for concern [52] .

Title: Exploring Leptospiral proteomes to identify potential candidates for vaccine design against Leptospirosis using an immunoinformatics approach 
Summary: In the present study, putative antigenic protein has been identified, of which B-cell (linear and conformational) and T-cell epitopes (HTL and CTL) have been predicted for the designing of peptide vaccines against leptospirosis. In the current study, one of the CD8+ restricted CTL epitope, 619 ILVPGAWKY 627 having high degree of conservancy among 46 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira, has also been predicted as antigenic site of linear B-cell and showing significant binding interaction with HLA-A*0201 protein; thus, considerably enhancing the possibility of this peptide to be a vaccine candidate.

Title: Role of Host Immune Response and Viral Load in the Differential Outcome of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza Virus Infection in Indian Patients 
Summary: The absence of viremia in both patient categories and relatively low viral load in the lung aspirates of the critically ill patients suggest that enhanced replication of the virus may not be an important contributor to the pathogenesis (Figure 1) . The observations of no increase in the levels of plasma IFNG in both patient categories when compared to controls as well as basal gene expression in the lungs of critically ill patients point out lack of co-ordination in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

Title:  
Summary: Namely, increasing the discard rate of all needles will, in particular, reduce the number of uninfected needles in the population and-due to asymmetries in how infected and uninfected needles are treated in the model-can actually lead to an increase in the proportion of infected needles in the population, increasing the probability that a user will become infected. S1(C) shows the fraction of infected needles in the population, and although one finds that the absolute number of infected needles in equilibrium will subside beyond a certain value of k (in our case this is around k = 0.10), we find that the fraction of infected needles is a monotonically increasing function of k. That is, for the parameters chosen, discarding needles universally will increase the likelihood of encountering an infected needle in the population of PWIDs.

Title: Glial-and Neuronal-Specific Expression of CCL5 mRNA in the Rat Brain 
Summary: We found that CCL5 mRNA in the corpus callosum is predominantly inside nuclei of cells, evidenced by the co-localization of DAPI (blue) with the CCL5 mRNA hybridization signal, that were in GFAP (Figures 3A1-4) , Iba-1 (Figures 3B1-4) and Nkx2.2 (Figures 3C1-4) positive cells. Here, we show that NeuN positive cells in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus are also CCL5 mRNA positive; together with previous findings that cortical neurons release CCL5 (Avdoshina et al., 2010) , our data suggest that CCL5 mRNA can be translated into proteins in neurons.

Title: Understanding the early dynamics of the 2014 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak in Ontario using the incidence decay and exponential adjustment (IDEA) model 
Summary: The structure of the simple, 2-parameter model is as follows: Where, I t is the number of incident cases in each model generation, R 0 is the basic reproductive number, d is a control parameter that allows for the decay of disease incidence over time and t is scaled in terms of the generation time. Using publically available data from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) on the occurrence of PEDV in Ontario in winter 2014 and our previously described IDEA model [20] , we have estimated the direct, farm-to-farm, basic reproductive number (R 0 ) for the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Ontario.

Summary: We also focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that are relevant to epidemiologic transition theory: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. Contextualizing disease trends, such as the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), including allergy and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease, within epidemiological transition theory, and attending to historical and evolutionary relationships between humans and pathogens, has direct implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology.

Title: Correspondence to: Communicable disease control in China: From Mao to now 
Summary: Another points to three influences: (i) models provided by Guomindang experiments on basic primary health care in the 1930s and 1940s, and the Soviet 'feldshers' (field doctors who provided primary health care at village level, supervised by trained staff at higher levels); (ii) the ideology of self-sufficiency, gender equality and egalitarianism (with the peasants as the agents, not just the beneficiaries of revolution), taken up by the Mao and the Communists in Yan'an in the 1940s (also giving rise to the preference for the traditional Chinese medicine practiced by barefoot doctors) and (iii) the political situation in the mid-1960s, which gave rise to Mao' s contention that the urban elite (including the Ministry of Health) was ignoring the backbone of the Revolution, the rural peasantry (18) , and undermining his reliance on them for his own status. Again, the mandating of hospital reporting drew the clinical sector into CDC as never before, raising clinicians' awareness on the public health significance of their actions on infectious diseases and population health; the coverage of this reporting system in 2009 was 100% of CDC-facilities, 97.8% of county-level or higher hospitals and 83.8% of township/village-level facilities, up from 66% in 2007, and the delay in reporting of and entering a notifiable disease report is reported to have dropped from almost 5 and 3.5 days, respectively, to less than one day (Dr Yang Weizhong, China CDC, personal communication).

Title: Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China: a 'One Health/Ecohealth' epitome 
Summary: The emergence of avian influenza viruses is linked to intensification of the poultry sector, both in high-income countries, where evidences link de-novo HPAI emergences to intensive poultry production systems, as well as in rapidly growing economies such as China, where the intensification of chicken and duck production at the interface with the wild virus reservoir supported the emergence and maintenance of several viruses of global public health relevance, such as the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. In the short term, better biosecurity and prevention practices, improved and more frequent cleaning and disinfection at the level of farm and live-poultry markets may contribute to reduce the circulation of the disease in poultry and the human exposure to prevailing viruses in countries sharing similar conditions.

Title: Receptor Binding Domain Based HIV Vaccines 
Summary: Similarly, the RBDs, including the CD4bs and CD4i, in the HIV-1 gp120 are also attractive targets for the development of AIDS vaccines because of the recent identification of several series of human broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4bs [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] and CD4i epitopes [39, 62, 70] in gp120. Therefore, to design vaccines with the ability to induce highly potent and cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies with high binding affinity, we recommend the following strategies: (1) construct an immunogen containing the discontinuous sequences of CD4bs and/or CD4i epitopes, and the natural trimeric conformation is essential; (2) induce conformational changes by mutation or glycan shield of the nonneutralizing immunodominant epitopes from the immunogen in order to reduce the immunogenicity of these epitopes; and (3) add an immune potentiation motif to the immunogen in order to enhance the immunogenicity of the RBD based vaccine.

Title: Article Geography Exploring the epidemic transmission network of SARS in-out flow in mainland China 
Summary: The results suggested that (1) the out-degree of Guangdong in the input flow network appeared as early as the beginning of January 2003, and its corresponding in-degree began in early February, indicating that Guangdong was the early original source of the SARS epidemic, from which the infections in many other provinces were at an early time ; (2) the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing in the input flow network appeared to occur as late as in early-mid March, and the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing's three surrounding provinces (Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia) also appeared late, indicating that control measures had taken effect in the early-mid period of the SARS epidemic in regions centered in Beijing, while the input cases from other provinces increased dramatically in the mid-late epidemic period due to the substantial increase of the range of epidemic spread; (3) the in-degree and out-degree of Guang-dong in the output flow network appeared early, and the in-degree increased to a maximum value in early February and was then maintained at the same value, indicating that Guangdong was the primary origin of the SARS epidemic in the early period and that there were continuous output cases from Guangdong to the other provinces throughout the entire epidemic period; and (4) in the output flow net-work, the in-degree and out-degree of Beijing and its three surrounding provinces (Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia) appeared late and gradually spread to the national level during the mid-late period. The combination analysis of the spatial distributions of the clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality in the input flow network and output flow network, which are shown in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively, indicated that (1) the distribution of the clustering coefficient in the input flow network had no significant clustering characteristics and the clustering coefficient of hotspot nodes of the SARS epidemic, including Beijing and Guangdong, was also not high, indicating that although there were several other nodes from which the input cases of hotspots nodes arose, these source nodes were too cold to form a cluster with each other; (2) in the output flow network, the distribution of the clustering coefficient of the nodes had significant clustering characteristics, and the connection density between the nodes connected to Beijing and Guangdong was very high, while the distribution of the nodes connected to Beijing and Guangdong was relatively concentrated mainly in the north, east and southwest of main-land China; (3) in the input flow network, the betweenness centrality distribution was also concentrated mainly in Guangdong and Beijing with its surrounding provinces showing that the spatial floating of the input cases had some clustering characteristics; and (4) several provinces surrounding Beijing and Guangdong formed a distance clustering trend in the output flow network, indicating that the spatial floating of output cases mainly covered a range between Beijing, Guangdong and their surrounding provinces.

Summary: Given the severity of the midline shift and her decreasing clinical presentation and respiratory status, vancomycin was added to the antibiotic regimen and pediatric surgery was consulted for left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) decortication and chest tube placement. Several pediatric studies of empyema management demonstrate that the use of VATS results in earlier, more complete resolution of the infection and decreased hospitalization in comparison with chest tube drainage and medical management [17] .

Title: Human coronavirus OC43 3CL protease and the potential of ML188 as a broad-spectrum lead compound: Homology modelling and molecular dynamic studies 
Summary: Homology modelling of the OC43 3CL pro The 3CL pro structure of HKU1 [PDB: 3D23] displayed a high sequence identity of 82.3% to the 3CL pro of OC43, with an e-value of 0.0. With the exception of the hydrogen bond between Tyr161 and His163, which may form in a dynamic system as the Tyr161 hydroxyl is in close proximity to the imidazole nitrogen of His163 but with incorrect geometry to form a hydrogen bond, all other interactions and conformations were maintained indicating that the homology model generated using the 3CL pro structure of HKU1 (3D23) as a template is representative of the active conformation of the enzyme (Figure 7) .

Title: The Feasibility of Canine Rabies Elimination in Africa: Dispelling Doubts with Data 
Summary: We conclude that (1) rabies substantially affects public and animal health sectors, hence regional and national priorities for control ought to be higher, (2) for practical purposes domestic dogs are the sole maintenance hosts and main source of infection for humans throughout most of Africa and Asia and sufficient levels of vaccination coverage in domestic dog populations should lead to elimination of canine rabies in most areas, (3) the vast majority of domestic dog populations across sub-Saharan Africa are accessible for vaccination with community sensitization being of paramount importance for the success of these programs, (4) improved local capacity in rabies surveillance and diagnostics will help evaluate the impact of control and elimination efforts, and (5) sustainable resources for effective dog vaccination campaigns are likely to be available through the development of intersectoral financing schemes involving both medical and veterinary sectors. In conclusion, here we show that a substantial body of epidemiological data have now been gathered through multiple studies demonstrating that: (1) rabies is an important disease that exerts a substantial burden on human and animal health, local and national economies and wildlife conservation, (2) domestic dogs are the sole population responsible for rabies maintenance and main source of infection for humans throughout most of Africa and Asia and therefore control of dog rabies should eliminate the disease, (3) elimination of rabies through domestic dog vaccination is epidemiologically feasible, (4) the vast majority of domestic dog populations across sub-Saharan Africa are accessible for vaccination and the few remaining factors compromising coverage can be addressed by engaging communities through education and awareness programs, (5) new diagnostic and surveillance approaches will help evaluate the impact of interventions and focus efforts towards elimination, and (6) dog rabies control is affordable, but is likely to require intersectoral approaches for sustainable programmes that will be needed to establish rabies-free areas.

Summary: Using this more controlled approach to examine the chicken immune response, we were able to demonstrate that the innate immune response to NDV in the chicken embryo appeared to be breed- (Figure 1 ) and/or subline-dependent (Figure 3) , with the possibility of having a relation to the MHC type demonstrated by differences in the inbred Fayoumi and inbred Leghorn sublines, which only differ in the MHC-bearing chromosome. Since only the Ghs6 and M15.2 sublines have been previously characterized for the level of susceptibility to NDV, expanding research in this area to include the other two sublines may provide a better insight into the use of the chicken embryo immune response as a tool to screen for the level of susceptibility to NDV of a particular line, and the role of the MHC complex.

Title: Selective inhibition of Ebola entry with selective estrogen receptor modulators by disrupting the endolysosomal calcium OPEN 
Summary: A filipin staining and Ebola pseudovirion entry assay demonstrated that SERMs and U18666a induce the cholesterol accumulation and inhibit the Ebola entry at the same concentration (approximately 1 μ M); however, the cholesterol accumulation (8 h) appeared after Ebola entry into the cytoplasm (2 h), implying that something changed within 2 h after the SERMs treatment to mediate the cholesterol accumulation and the inhibition of Ebola entry. In this study, we demonstrated that SERMs inhibit Ebola pseudovion entry and induce cholesterol accumulation at equal dosages, and they can reduce the cellular sphingosine and upregulate the endolysosomal calcium levels which is regulated by sphingosine through TPC1 and TPC2 54 , moreover, chelation of endolysosomal calcium significantly and specifically inhibited the entry of Ebola.

The synthesis also suggested that the perceived necessity, efficacy and feasibility of adopting non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control may be influenced by personal and cultural beliefs about respiratory infection transmission, perceptions and feelings about vulnerability to respiratory infections, and concerns around self-diagnosis of respiratory infections and the communication of reliable information about respiratory infections in emerging respiratory infection outbreaks.

(26) Embedded in much of their work is the directly observed or implied importance not only of isotype (36) but also species matches in establishing Fc-FcR affinity: human, mouse, and non-human primate (NHP) FcR are non-equivalent in binding to any given Ab (typically, human IgG1 is the chosen type), and nomenclature of FcR in the various species is a poor guide to Ab affinity and function.

Title: Inferring population-level contact heterogeneity from common epidemic data 
Summary: We test our framework in three stages using (i) synthetic contact network and synthetic epidemiological data to understand the inferential power of each epidemiological measure under idealized conditions; (ii) empirical contact network and synthetic epidemiological data to assess how informative each measure is given complex underlying network structure but idealized epidemiological assumptions; and (iii) empirical epidemiological data from historical and recent epidemic outbreaks where the contact network is unobserved to evaluate this method on systems with both complex network structure and complex epidemiology. In cases where an estimate of mean degree is not provided, we assume a broad range of values for mean degree, and use a range of values for R 0 (provided in the study or from the literature), to calculate a value for T based on the following relationship (where p k is the proportion of nodes with degree k from equations (2.2), (2.3) or (2.4)) [5] : The three empirical outbreaks are results of respiratory, sexual and food-borne diseases, respectively.

Title: Transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 
Summary: The relation follows from a standard SEIR model [11, 23] : where E[C(t + τ)] is the expected number of new cases at time t + τ, b(R, γ, κ) defines the progression of cases, γ -1 and κ -1 are the infectious and latent periods, respectively, and C(t) is the observed number of new cases at time t. The progression operator is given by: Where λ + is the dominant eigenvalue derived from linearization of the SEIR model around disease-free equilibrium, following [15]  In this approach, both the latent and infectious periods (1/γ, 1/κ) are fixed and, hence, the only parameter to be estimated is R. We made two different assumptions for the latent and infectious periods to illustrate a short infection process consistent with seasonal influenza [25] (k -1 = 1.5 days and γ-1 = 1.5 days, so that the generation interval is 3.0 days) and a longer infection process in line with descriptions of the prolonged course of A/H7N9 infections in humans (k -1 = 3 days, γ-1 = 3 days, so that the generation interval is 6.0 days) [4, 5, 26] . Although there is uncertainty in the exposure history of A/H7N9 patients, the nature of the reservoir of this virus, and cluster sizes and frequency, we can use R estimates based on exposure and contact information [22, 23] to set the initial prior distributions for R in our Bayesian estimation scheme.

Summary: [63] demonstrated that silencing of two major constituents of the Arp2/3 complex resulted in significant reduction if MHV infectivity, and use of actin cytoskeleton altering agents in the early stages of infection had similar restrictive effects on infection, pointing to GTPase, and specifically Cdc42 involvement in the entry process. Indeed, given that the study of various Cdc42-inhibitors in HIV-1 seems to have demonstrated that inhibition of all Cdc42 function may result in dysregulation of other Rho family GTPases, it is possible that the broadly-acting agents used in the past to "screen" for Cdc42 involvement in virus species' entry processes may have produced falsely negative results.

In March of 2014, novel variant G1b PEDV isolates have been found in South Korea, which were similar to the variants reported in China, the United States, and recently in several European countries [61] .

Title: Passive Transfer of A Germline-like Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects Transgenic Mice Against Lethal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection 
Summary: However, we also noted the recovery of bodyweight loss and the reduction of viral loads in mice treated with 1 mg of m336 at 12 hrs after infection were slower than those treated with 0.1 mg of m336, as shown in Figs 2A and 3B, respectively. The transgenic mice that we used for evaluating the prophylactic and, especially, the therapeutic efficacy of this m336 antibody are extremely sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and disease, with LD 50 and ID 50 of 4.5 and 0.4 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV, respectively (data not shown), titers which are lower than our original estimations 38 .

Title:  
Summary: For Hepatitis B, some of the overlapping gene regions of protein P appear disordered, either in protein P, or in protein S. A more systematic analysis of this relationship is complicated, since many overlapping proteins are very short, and very short proteins are often very disordered simply because they are too short to support an ordered structure. Thus, while for individual proteins, investigators need to consider carefully whether they are interested in the disorder in the precursor polyprotein, or as is more usually of interest, in the mature post-cleavage products, it is important to ensure that the predictions are carried out on the appropriate state, since disorder is greater at protein termini.

Title: Experimental feline enteric coronavirus infection reveals an aberrant infection pattern and shedding of mutants with impaired infectivity in enterocyte cultures OPEN 
Summary: In contrast to the early shedding, viruses shed by all cats at the end of the infection had undergone numerous changes in the viral genome, with the spike protein being the most affected in all cats ( Table 3) . This explanation seems also very unlikely, as 1) cats were housed separately and precautions were taken to avoid inadvertent transmission, 2) FCoV RNA was found in saliva of this cat until 2 days after inoculation (data not shown), 3) viral RNA was found in faeces at day 2, indicating passage of the inoculum without any further infection, and 4) the FECV genome in cat 2 differed markedly from the other cats.

Title: Louis-Jeantet Prize Winner: Commentary Dissecting human antibody responses: useful, basic and surprising findings 
Summary: I will discuss how a target-agnostic approach based on highthroughput screening of antibodies produced by cultured B cells and plasma cells has not only provided potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against a range of pathogens, but has also advanced our understanding of basic aspects of the immune response, from host-pathogen interaction to the role of somatic mutations in affinity maturation and in the diversification of the antibody response. Finally, studies of the antibody response in humans can shed light on basic aspects of the immune response, such as the role of somatic mutations and the mechanisms that underpin the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies or autoantibodies, and possibly uncover examples of such mechanisms that may be uniquely developed or better identified in humans.

Title: Dating the time of viral subtype divergence 
Summary: These results are summarized in Table 2 and Histograms of the time of most recent common ancestor for subtypes A-H3N2, B and C, respectively, derived from molecular clock estimates on hemagglutinin (HA), matrix (MP) and nonstructural (NS) gene sequences This discrepancy between the two sets of estimates of the TMRCA likely owes to the inability of the MCA to integrate information from the period of evolution between the two subtypes, leading to a substantial underestimate of the rate of substitution, and consequent underestimation of the date of the TMRCA. We present a new method for ascertaining the rate of nucleotide substitution between subtypes and apply this method together with traditional MCA methods to date the divergence of influenza subtypes A-H3N2, B, and C. We use three genes, HA, MP and NS, to date two types of divergence events: the time of the most recent common of each subtype and the time of divergence between two subtypes, A-H3N2 and B.

Title: Unanswered questions about the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
Summary: The persistence of MERS-CoV for more than 3 times the duration than SARS, which had a higher R0, highlights the question of why the infection is still ongoing in humans, and what is the source of ongoing transmission to humans? Based on the available evidence, multiple introductions from zoonotic sources to humans, resulting in limited clusters of cases is the most likely explanation of how MERS CoV has persisted in human populations for a prolonged period despite a low R0, although it is unknown how many jumps to humans have occurred, or what the mode of transmission is between the animals and humans [34] .

Summary: In parallel, 80 sera found DicVnegative by HTS analysis were randomly selected throughout the entire recruitment period of 2015 and assessed by the DicV-Capsid and DicV-ORF1/RdRp real-time RT-PCR assays; 5 were found positive (4 sera collected in February and 1 in July; viral load ranged from < 1.32E3 to 2.11E4 viral RNA copies/mL of sera) suggesting that the DicV prevalence of 15.4% observed by HTS represents a minimal estimate. In contrast to the HTS analysis results obtained with the paediatric cohort, the presence of DicV RNA was detected in only one of 77 (1.3%) plasma specimens from the adult cohort (2 reads, real-time RT-PCRs were performed but the results were not conclusive due to the presence of a very strong PCR inhibition) ( Figure 1 ).

Predictions for the pathogen invasion threshold-defined as both R 0 > 1 and as the probability of observing a primary infection eventobtained from deterministic and stochastic realizations of our epidemiological model were qualitatively similar to experimental epidemics, suggesting that the invasion threshold may be estimated from a simple independently parameterized epidemiological model.

Summary: The resolution of the diffraction data collected from dehydrated crystals ranges from 1.1 Å to 4.5-5 Å, with resolution improvements that in some cases have been >10 Å; while the solvent content values range from 23% to 85%, with a decrease upon dehydration that generally has been <10%. As expected, the best improvements in the X-ray diffraction power of protein crystals have been observed when the dehydration process has been applied to crystals with the highest solvent contents.

Title: When Viruses Don't Go Viral: The Importance of Host Phylogeographic Structure in the Spatial Spread of Arenaviruses 
Summary: Neither of these regions of high host-movement-resistance are likely to match the true centre of the GAIV-MORV transition zone nor appear to genetically structure the arenavirus associated with the B-V host subtaxon: MORV occurs on both sides of D-E and the clade MORV-II occurs in localities J as well as K. A partial mantel test correlating mean arenavirus (GAIV+MORV) genetic distance between pairwise localities to the landscape resistance, while partialing out the earth distance matrix, was not significant (R 2 = -0.13, p = 0.95). The convergent spatial patterns in and this study are thus consistent with a general association of the arenaviruses of M. natalensis to particular subtaxa, implying that LASV is restricted to the West African range of the subtaxon corresponding with A-I matrilineage.

Title: PreDicta chip-based high resolution diagnosis of rhinovirus-induced wheeze 
Summary: Using the PreDicta chip we could demonstrate in a cohort of 120 pre-school children with acute wheeze and a follow-up visit that the RV-specific antibody response (IgG > IgA) is directed against an N-terminal peptide of the major capsid protein VP1 which confirms earlier results obtained by the mapping of RV89-specific antibody responses 33 . In conclusion, we developed and evaluated a high-resolution antibody assay based on micro-arrayed peptides and recombinant antigens from the most common RV strains to identify antibody signatures discriminating RV infections at the levels of different RV species and allowed to point towards the culprit species responsible for the triggering of acute pre-school wheezing.

The results of the HMBC experiments rely on the fact that the anomeric proton may see the aryl bearing pyrazole carbon in 3d and 5d, but not in 4d and 6d, while the NOESY results would explain the spatial proximity of the anomeric proton to either the protons in the -CH 2 CN group or to the ortho protons of the aryl group.

Title: When are pathogen genome sequences informative of transmission events? 
Summary: This value is closely related to the zero term in the transmission divergence distribution, however notable observations include that over 90% of sequences in S. sonnei and S. pneumoniae outbreaks were identical under both models of sequence evolution, and on average 30% to 50% of sequences in MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks were identical depending on the model of within-host diversity. Under the outbreaker model, higher average transmission divergence strongly reduced posterior entropy, resulting in essentially complete support for a single transmission We also related the informativeness of WGS data to the proportion of sequences that were unique in an outbreak, and found a nearly linear relationship for both outbreaker and phybreak reconstructions (Fig 3A) .

Title: Identification of Cis-Acting Elements on Positive-Strand Subgenomic mRNA Required for the Synthesis of Negative-Strand Counterpart in Bovine Coronavirus 
Summary: Since (1) the synthesis of the (−)-strand counterpart occurred under the similar experimental conditions as determined by the level of reporter-containing (+)-strand sgmRNA constructs, 18S rRNA, and M sgmRNA of helper virus BCoV at 8 hpt (VP0) with Northern blot assay ( Figure 2D ) and (2) these sgmRNA constructs were dissemination-defective ( Figure S2 ), these results suggest that the 5' leader sequence along with the 3'-terminal 55 nts and higher-order structure pseudoknot in sgmRNA are critical cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. Although it has been demonstrated for MHV DI RNA that the 5' UTR, including the leader sequence, does not affect the synthesis of (−)-strand sgmRNA [26] , we found here in this study that the leader sequence was required for the efficient synthesis of BCoV (−)-strand sgmRNA 7 ( Figure 2B ).

Title: Zoonotic Viruses Associated with Illegally Imported Wildlife Products 
Summary: While we were successful in demonstrating the presence of SFV and herpesviruses in bushmeat specimens, our pilot study was limited by the range, number, and variable condition of products available to us and was not intended to be a comprehensive review of presence or to measure prevalence of all pathogens imported in wildlife products. Because our study only included a small number of CDCregulated species and excluded products of ungulate, carnivore, reptile, avian and other origin, as well as any live animal imports, all of which may carry zoonotic pathogens or diseases that threaten domestic livestock or native wildlife, in addition to the fact that virus isolation was not performed in our study to determine the infectiousness of the specimens at the time of confiscation, there is a large component of zoonotic disease risk assessment not included in this study.

Title: Identification and Characterization of a Novel Alpaca Respiratory Coronavirus Most Closely Related to the Human Coronavirus 229E 
Summary: Additional characteristics common to the ACoV and other alphacoronaviruses include the length of the genome, gene organization, a potential small ORF downstream of the nucleocapsid gene and an transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) with a core sequence (CS) sequence (AACUAAA) that was found throughout the genome [19] . Nucleotide comparison of spike gene sequences from the ACoV and isolates of HCoV-229E covering a span of five decades was analyzed, and the ACoV was observed to be most similar to HCoV-229E viruses isolated in the 1960's to early 1980's ( Figure 5 ).

Summary: GRFT alone or with mannose 1.3 and 0.94 A domain-swapped dimer, a Jacalin-related lectin with a β-prism motif, and three identical mannose-binding sites on each monomer [19] GRFT with glucose or N-acetylglucosamine 30-1.50 and 30-1.56 All six monosaccharide binding sites of GRFT are occupied by both glucose and N-acetylglucosamine with a mode of binding similar to that of mannose [23] GRFT with 1-6α-mannobiose or maltose 2.0 and 1.5 The binding of 1-6α-mannobiose is similar to that of mannose and the binding of maltose is weaker than that of mannose [22] Monomeric GRFT 30-0.97 Reduced activity against HIV-1 due to a loss of multivalent interaction and the binding of a monomeric GRFT to two different nona-mannosides [20] GRFT with a disrupted carbohydrate-binding site NMR study Reduced binding to mannose and a weaker correlation between anti-HIV-1 activity and gp120 binding [21]  Several studies have described the in vitro anti-HIV activities and cytotoxicity of GRFT (Table 2) . Although the multivalent interaction of GRFT with high-mannose oligosaccharides is believed to account for most of its picomolar antiviral potency, the looser correlation between gp120-binding ability and HIV inhibitory potency for the binding site mutants of GRFT suggests the possibility of another unknown antiviral mechanism of GRFT that is not based on simple gp120 binding [21] .

Moreover, the MLOGD score in the +2/ORFX frame within the ORFX region was significantly greater than the score in the +0/ ORF1a frame, indicating that the ORFX product is subject to stronger functional constraints than the product of the overlapping region of ORF1a (which indeed has a negative MLOGD score towards the 5'-terminal half of the ORFX region).

Summary: The analyses of the present study were two-fold: 1) a nonrandomness index [17] derived from the IBS method was applied to quantify the nonlinear aspect of HRV according to b-AR genotype and to test the correlation of this index with standard HRV indices; and 2) using agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we unsupervisedly categorized these subjects into clusters based on pairwise dissimilarity among heart rate dynamics, and then we investigated the association of these clustering patterns with b-AR gene polymorphisms. Moreover, we illustrate that a bottom-up approach using the IBS method was able to measure the dissimilarity of heart rate dynamics among individuals, and we show that the resulting clusters were associated with b 2 -AR Arg16Gly genotype, indicating an impact of this b 2 -AR polymorphism on acceleration/deceleration patterns of heart rate oscillations.

Summary: Annual rates of hospital admission for severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis), individual complications, and gallstone-related procedures (elective and non-elective cholecystectomy, ERCP) among the study population were calculated by dividing the number of patients with confirmed incident gallstone disease by the mid-year Taiwanese population of that year. In this study, an analysis of national health insurance claims data found that the rate of hospital admission for severe gallstone disease per 1000 population in Taiwan was 0.60 for men and 0.59 for women during 1997-2005.

Title: The molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses associated with asthma attacks A single-center observational study in Japan 
Summary: This study was the first to show that various respiratory viruses such as HRV, hMPV, Inf-V, and RSV were associated with asthma attacks in Japanese adult patients. [19] Furthermore, previous reports described other respiratory viruses, such as hMPV, [20] RSV, parainfluenza virus, Inf-V, and coronavirus, as a cause of asthma attack in adults, [4] and the present study clearly demonstrated the main causative viruses are HRV, hMPV, RSV, and Inf-V. What is more important is the finding in our study that the various VRIs can cause asthma attacks with a seasonal predilection in each virus; however, the frequency of VRIs in asthma attack patients seem to be equal throughout the seasons.

Title: Transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets improves the interpretation of gene expression data 
Summary: These probesets, however, might not be really one-to-one mapping to the identified transcript targets, as our strategy was based on the premise that most probesets were specific for certain genes, and our blast was limited to the candidate transcripts associated with the probesets, but not the entire transcript pool. In this work, we re-annotated the probesets of two widely used Affymetrix arrays, MOE430A_2 and HG-U133A, via proper association and rigorous alignment procedures in a transcript perspective, and demonstrated the necessity and advantage of exploring microarray data at the transcript or protein level, instead of the conventional gene level.

Summary: Our results show that the serum of mice immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e specifically binds to H1N1-infected MDCK cells, indicating that the M2e-specific antibodies induced by p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunization recognize the M2 protein on the surface of cells infected with influenza virus ( Figure S1 ). Similarly, the lung viral titer in H9N2 challenged mice immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e was significantly lower than that in the control immunized group (p < 0.05), but the differences in the H6N6 and H10N8 challenged groups immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e compared to their respective control groups were not significant ( Figure 5(B) , (E), (H)).

Title: Bayesian uncertainty quantification for transmissibility of influenza, norovirus and Ebola using information geometry 
Summary: The first of these assumes that the intervention is 'quarantine-like' and completely halts transmission after administration, leading to an epidemic with reproduction number Lðt; uÞ dt: ð2:6Þ The second, however, assumes that the individual must not have progressed from the 'latent' to the 'infectious' class and is therefore similar to some models of administration of antiviral medication like Tamiflu [9, 10] , leading to an epidemic with reproduction number We note from standard results in mathematical epidemiology [4] that if the infection rate is b, and the mean infectious period is 1/g, then the basic reproductive ratio is R 0 ¼ b/g, and for an epidemic with reproduction number R the epidemic final size Z is given by the solution to the transcendental equation above, a range of delays, and fitted values of the parameters (v, g) at a fixed value of R 0 ¼ 1.4 (as in [8] ) to make a direct comparison, although it would be straightforward to place a distribution on R 0 . [25] , where individuals were infected under controlled conditions and observations of viral titre in faeces made irregularly at times belonging to a set T : These data are shown in figure 3a and since they do not aggregate in the same way as the influenza data the likelihood function is so s is here an additional parameter that must be estimated, and we have rescaled the infectiousness as before using t. This makes the norovirus parameter space dimension 4, in contrast to dimension 3 for influenza, with u ¼ ðt, v, g, sÞ.

However, metagenomic studies targeting the entire body of the bloodsucking arthropod not only allow for the description of the viral flora within the arthropod, which highlight the emerging infectious agents or insect-specific viruses as tools for vector population control, but they also allow for the study of interactions between viral and bacterial communities that may result in viral interference (e.g., Wolbachia endosymbiont and Dengue virus interactions [102, 103] ) This information can lead to the development of new antiviral strategies.

Title: Transmission dynamics and control of Ebola virus disease (EVD): a review Medicine for Global Health 
Summary: In these models, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , in a completely susceptible population and in the absence of control interventions is computed as the product of the mean transmission rate during the intervention-free course of the outbreak, β 0 , and the mean infectious period, 1/γ . Susceptible individuals infected through contact with infectious individuals (secondary cases) enter the latent period at rate β(t) (I + l(t) H) /N(t) where β(t) is the mean human-to-human transmission rate per day, l(t) quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients compared to symptomatic patients in the community, and N (t) is the total population size at time t. Thus, values of l(t) between 0 and 1 would reflect the effectiveness of hospital isolation measures that decrease Ebola transmission probability below that seen in the community, and values above 1.0 denote increased transmission in the hospital relative to the community, potentially due to biological and/or epidemiological reasons (for example, exposure to body fluids).

Summary: The functional activities of membrane proteins are modulated by the structure of the surrounding lipids molecules in the membrane [1, 2] ; thus the composition of the lipid bilayer can affect the inter-or intra-molecular interactions between the lipid bilayer and membrane proteins [3] . The data presented in the first column of Figure 7 show that the basal ATPase activity for assembly in the nanodiscs and detergent (~700 nmol/min/mg) is 10-fold higher than in proteoliposomes because of the decrease in the activation energy barrier of the transporter [78] in detergent micelles and nanodiscs.

Summary: Judged based on the appearance of the fever data alone, it was not clear whether fever rates from a single ED would be sufficient to detect significant increases in febrile disease, or whether the detected increases would correspond with the periods of elevated influenza activity during the period of the study. The collection of temperature measurements during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009-2010 provided a unique opportunity, and notable increases in fever rates were detected both during the regional outbreak of this pandemic and during the period of widespread seasonal influenza transmission in 2010-2011.

Title: Hotspot Hunter: a computational system for large-scale screening and selection of candidate immunological hotspots in pathogen proteomes 
Summary: Given the large size of pathogen proteomes, it is painstaking to integrate the individual prediction results, and therefore impractical to use these tools for large-scale systematic study of promiscuous epitopes, which is necessary for a global view of the localizations of the epitopes in the proteome and analysis of their antigenic diversity. First, the prediction engine combines the strengths of the ANN and SVM methods for better and more robust prediction performance; second, it presents users with predicted immunological hotspots, which are regions of high concentration of predicted promiscuous HLA binding peptides; third, it is suitable for systematic studies of a large set of pathogen proteomes as it can concurrently analyze multiple sequences and present a map providing a global view of their localizations in the proteome, which is the main novelty of the system; and finally, the system provides a utility for selecting candidate experimental targets based on antigenic diversity analysis.

Summary: An earlier study in the UK reported a high prevalence of FeLV in sick cats suspected of having FeLV or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infections (18%) as well as in young healthy cats (5%) [24] , but two more recent studies reported also a decreased FeLV prevalence in the UK: 3.5% of 517 stray cats in the Birmingham area (1.4% of the healthy cats; 6.9% of the sick cats) in 1997 were FeLV-infected, and 2.3% of the cats tested positive in two rehoming centres in the midlands and Eastern part of England in 2011/12 [61, 62] . The vaccination rate was even higher in the United Kingdom, where 81.5% of the cats in the present study had been FeLV vaccinated, and only 0.7% of the cats were FeLV-positive.

Title: Discovery of DNA Viruses in Wild-Caught Mosquitoes Using Small RNA High throughput Sequencing 
Summary: Although most of the viral coding transcripts (NS1, NS2, and Capsid) were covered by the small viral RNA sequences, the small RNAs were not evenly distributed along the transcripts. Our results suggest that small RNA sequencing is able to identify not only RNA viruses, but also DNA viruses in wild-caught mosquitoes, obviating the need for culture-based virus isolation or for prior knowledge of the etiologic agent.

Summary: To the Editor-To our knowledge, no formal recommendations exist for the inclusion of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in disaster planning or emergency response preparedness efforts. ASPs that are integrated with hospital infection prevention programs have an advantage in response efforts to emerging pathogens in that (1) they are likely to have pre-existing infection prevention skills and experience, (2) they are likely to be involved in response efforts early, and (3) they will have access to and influence with key stakeholders.

Title: Rapid development of vaccines against emerging pathogens: The replication-deficient simian adenovirus platform technology 
Summary: Thus, following an outbreak of a disease which resulted in 28,616 known cases and 11,310 deaths, lasting from the first case in December 2013 to the end of virus transmission in June 2016, and for which two vaccines were well advanced in pre-clinical development and preparation for clinical trials before the outbreak began, it was only possible to test efficacy of one of these vaccines in the declining months of the outbreak. The use of platform technologies to produce vaccines against multiple diseases has the potential to greatly reduce the time and cost required to develop novel vaccines to the point at which safety and immunogenicity has been established, master seed stocks of the vaccines have been produced and stockpiles have been prepared for use should an outbreak occur.

Summary: To further investigate which factors account for the low codon usage bias of MERS-CoV and the related viruses, we analysed the relationship between the ENC value and the percentage of G or C in the third site of codons (GC3s) % in MERS-CoV genomes. This was also in accordance with the SD values of the RSCU of the MERS human/ camel isolates; (2) In addition to mutational pressure, there are other factors, such as natural selection, which might influence the codon bias of MERS-CoV of human/ camel isolates; (3) CoV of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus have distinct codon usage patterns compared with the MERS-CoV human/ camel isolates: in the plots, the data points were closer to the axes than to the origin; (4) The codon usage bias patterns of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus CoV were not only caused by mutational bias, but also by natural selection pressure, which might have had a larger effect than mutational bias.

Based on the proposed analysis, we believe that SCH's early preparedness to the epidemic and its commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy, which included actions during the first days of the outbreak such as sharing of information in a timely manner with the public and domestic and international organizations, and acknowledging the uncertainty of the situation, favored the establishment of the SCH's image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of overall response efforts and effective rumor control during the course of the outbreak.

Title: Establishment of Hairy Root Cultures by Agrobacterium Rhizogenes Mediated Transformation of Isatis Tinctoria L. for the Efficient Production of Flavonoids and Evaluation of Antioxidant Activities 
Summary: However, the osmolality of culture medium under high sucrose concentration (3.0-4.0%) could cause the loss of cell viability by the dehydration and promote the diffusion of phytochemicals from root tissues into the liquid medium, thus leading to the low biomass DW and TFL content. By the aid of the above mathematical models, the optimal conditions for biomass DW and TFL content in ITHRCs were calculated as follows: culture temperature 24.71°C, sucrose concentration 3.06%, inoculum size 0.75% and harvest time 23.74 days.

Title: Assortativity and the Probability of Epidemic Extinction: A Case Study of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1-2009) 
Summary: All panels, (a)-(c), examine the sensitivity of the probability of extinction in a fully susceptible large population given 10 index cases with R = 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6, respectively, with different θ, the proportion of within-group mixing and the proportion of adult index cases. Given 10 index cases with θ = 1, the results were independent of the proportion of adult index cases, because a 1 + a 2 = 10 and π 2 = 1 (for θ = 1), whatever the number of adults, a 2 , the extinction probability is That is, as mixing becomes more and more assortative, the contribution of the initial number of adults, a 2 to the risk of a major epidemic becomes less important, and moreover, an increase in the proportion of adults indirectly reduces a 1 , leading to an increase in the probability of extinction.

Summary: In view of the significant impact of CDV infections on the health of domestic dogs, which are the main reservoir hosts, and the lack of data on the epidemiological characteristics of these infections in the world, this observational study and meta-analysis aimed to determine and better understand the individual and pooled frequency patterns of detectable CDV using various molecular and serological tests. To do so, the following inclusion criteria were used: 1) original articles published in scientific journals that contained information on serological and molecular surveys for the detection of CDV in domestic dogs; 2) studies containing data related to the proportion/rate of viral infection by laboratory tests; 3) seroepidemiological surveys for the detection of anti-CDV antibodies that included data concerning groups of animals not vaccinated against CDV; 4) data secondary to CDV positivity to analyze risk factors such as gender, age, vaccine status, breed, coinfection and lifestyle (free-ranging dogs versus non-free-ranging dogs); and 5) studies that used the most conventional ante-mortem detection tests.

Summary: In order to address this knowledge gap, we constructed five recombinant vectors based on human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein: -the full-length S glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); -two secreted variants of the receptor binding domain of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein containing the alkaline phosphatase leader peptide (the RBD and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 to increase stability and immunogenicity [18, 19] ); and -two transmembrane (TM) forms localized in the plasma membrane of the cell: either the full-length S or the RBD with the TM domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein. The studies have yielded the following results: -The most powerful humoral immune response was observed in animals immunized with the membranebound form of the RBD (rAd5-RBD-G); -Only the membrane forms of MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G and rAd5-RBD-G) induced the generation of neutralizing antibodies in all vaccinated mice; -The most significant cellular immune response developed after immunization of animals with the fulllength glycoprotein (rAd5-S); and -Vaccination of mice with all developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response.

The fusion data with mutations to the highly interfacial aromatic residues Trp, Tyr, and Phe support the notion that an interfacial location of the residue in this position is more important than its potential to be protonated at low pH or to be drawn deeper into the membrane by a hydrophobic residue in this position.

Summary: Interestingly, while this study claimed that all the antibodies were capable of neutralizing GM-CSF in the TF-1 bioassay, we show that neutralization by single antibodies is strictly dependent on the concentration of the cytokine and the number of receptors in the system, a finding that can be explained by the reversibility of antibody-antigen interaction, according to the law of mass action, and the affinity of GM-CSF receptor for its ligand, which is higher than that of antibodies 24, 25 . A key observation in this study was that, when injected in mice, single antibodies led to the accumulation of a large pool of longlived GM-CSF that was still able to dissociate and trigger the receptor, as shown by the capacity of the sera to stimulate proliferation of TF-1 cells.

Title: Efficacy and safety of iota-carrageenan nasal spray versus placebo in early treatment of the common cold in adults: the ICICC trial 
Summary: The data for a patient with a TSS 2-4 of 16.7 (treated in the I-C group) was removed for an exploratory analysis, because his on-treatment symptom scores were well out of range when compared with the adjusted mean values of 6.39 for placebo and 5.77 for I-C patients ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the patient may have misunderstood the process of symptom reporting. The analyses from the ICICC trial support the findings of three previous randomized clinical trials, which examined I-C nasal spray in adults [5, 7] and children [6] with acute common cold symptoms: in 35 adult patients, administration of I-C nasal spray significantly reduced cold symptoms and the viral concentration in nasal lavages [5] ; in 203 adult patients, cold duration was significantly shorter in virus-positive patients treated with I-C, viral load was significantly reduced, and there was a significantly faster reduction of common cold symptoms after the first 3 days of treatment [7] ; and in 153 children, although there was no significant difference between the I-C group and the placebo group for mean total symptom score, exploratory analyses indicated a positive effect on symptoms in patients in whom less co-medication or no co-medication was used [6] .

Title: Reducing the Impact of the Next Influenza Pandemic Using Household-Based Public Health Interventions A B S T R A C T Background 
Summary: Our estimated changes in IAR were also sensitive to the delay in the provision of anti-virals to households and to the delay in the isolation of symptomatic individuals ( Figure  4B ), although less so than to p c and h. In deciding whether to implement any or all of the policies described here, local public health officials may wish to consider available epidemiological data (to assess R 0 and h) and also estimate the levels of compliance that could be achieved for the different options in their populations. Also, the marginal benefits of the use of anti-virals or isolation (policies QI, QA, and QIA versus Q) may not be justified if the average times for the provision of these services exceed 3 to 4 d, given that the quarantine period is set at 7 d. Levels of compliance with quarantine and isolation would likely be improved in the early and late stages of the epidemic by the availability of a viable diagnostic.

Title: Controlling epidemic spread by social distancing: Do it well or not at all 
Summary: This leads to a reduction in the total number of contacts when control is used, compared to the case when it is not used, For any given r (0) i , the value of contacts (no control) is fixed: each individual will make contact with all of its neighbours within radius r (0) i , so a fixed number of contacts occurs at each time step, and contacts (no control) can be calculated by multiplying this number by the length of the reference period. For simplicity we have also assumed that the only difference between the long-range links and the local links is in the topology of interactions; otherwise the long range links are treated the same as short-range links, in terms of reduction of contacts in response to infection and their contribution to the individual well-being.

Title: Adaptive Management and the Value of Information: Learning Via Intervention in Epidemiology 
Summary: In the face of uncertainty about the susceptible age distribution for measles, the optimal initial response depends both on the logistical capacity (i.e., the daily vaccination rate) and the time required to assess and implement an updated age target. In the measles example, we illustrate that while the expected cost of an adaptive strategy is always less than that of a single fixed strategy, optimal vaccine targets and the additional benefit of an adaptive approach depend both on uncertainty about the age-distribution of the at-risk population and on the logistical constraints of implementing improved interventions.

Title:  
Summary: In a Canadian press report [3] on the Skowronski paper, Ross Upshur, head of the University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics, was quoted as saying ''Making public health policy during a pandemic based on data most people hadn't seen was far from ideal,'' adding that he believes the question of when public health priorities trump rules of scientific publication remains to be resolved: ''Putting the imprimatur of a high impact peer review journal first is I think what we need to have the discussion about.'' Of course, the authors of this paper, and of all the articles published from study of the SARS epidemic and the H1N1 pandemic, would say they were not seeking such an ''imprimatur'' for the sake of it, but because as yet there is no widely accepted alternative to the ''quality'' stamp that peer review imparts.

Title: Having a usual source of care and its associated factors in Korean adults: a cross-sectional study of the 2012 Korea Health Panel Survey 
Summary: The distributions of those who had physicians as a USC by type of institution of a USC were significantly different (P < 0.001); those who had a combination of a place and a physician as a USC cited private community clinics as their USCs more frequently than did those who had only a place without a physician as a USC (61.8% vs. 48.6%); for hospitals, though, the findings were the reverse (Table 3) . In conclusion, the proportion of Korean adults who have a USC is extremely low (21.5% for place and 13.9% for physician), the most influential factor of having a USC is having a chronic disease, and Korean patients experience much poorer health care coordination than do patients in other industrialized countries [21] .

Title: Vaccines Through Centuries: Major Cornerstones of Global Health 
Summary: Experiments followed to improve the durability of the protective response of the vaccine, and in 1926, the importance of aluminum salts as an adjuvant added to the vaccine to augment the immune response to the antigen, became apparent (38) . According to the CDC, this year 95% of the children were vaccinated in the U.S., leaving 5% unvaccinated due to religious and philosophical exemptions or even parental refusal due to the fear of vaccine's side effects and concerns regarding autism from vaccines (60); this is still a critical number since the unvaccinated would pose risk of outbreaks even among the immunized, which necessitates the need for additional awareness campaigns regarding the importance of vaccination since vaccines remain the only plausible measure of protection against preventable diseases.

Title: Surveillance of febrile patients in a district and evaluation of their spatiotemporal associations: a pilot study 
Summary: We tried to use a common sense approach in deriving this definition: a cluster of three or more persons with the same clinical syndrome is often regarded as epidemiologically significant in outbreak investigation; a time frame of 3 days (to define temporal association) is within the incubation period of most infectious diseases [13] ; and an activity space of 50 m in radius should meet the living conditions for most of the people living in the district under our study. This method provides an objective estimate on the likelihood of clustering, and it has been applied in the study of geographical distribution of diseases over a period of time [18, 19] , investigations of outbreaks and their progression [20, 21] , and analysis of syndromic data from emergency department visits [10, 22] , among the others.

Title: Issue 1 | e3 Neglected Diseases Citation 
Summary: Three recent international meetings on plague (Box 2) concluded that: (1) it should be re-emphasised that the plague bacillus (Yersinia pestis) still causes several thousand human cases per year [2, 3] (Figure 1 ); (2) locally perceived risks far outstrip the objective risk based purely on the number of cases [2] ; (3) climate change might increase the risk of plague outbreaks where plague is currently endemic and new plague areas might arise [2, 4] ; (4) remarkably little is known about the dynamics of plague in its natural reservoirs and hence about changing risks for humans [5] ; and, therefore, (5) plague should be taken much more seriously by the international community than appears to be the case. Human plague may be contracted from (1) being bitten by the fleas of wildlife rodent species in rural settings (e.g., in the south-western United States [22, 23] ) or of commensal rodents that move freely between villages and the forest habitats occupied by reservoir hosts (e.g., in Tanzania); rodents' movements have become more frequent as human activity has fragmented the forest [24] ; (2) eating infected animals such as guinea pigs in Peru and Ecuador [25, 26] or camels that contract the disease from rodent fleas in Central Asia and the Middle East [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] ; or (3) handling cats infected through the consumption of plague-infected rodents in Africa or the United States [32] [33] [34] .

Title: Inferring Infection Patterns Based on a Connectivity Map of Host Transcriptional Responses 
Summary: Using four cases, we illustrated that such resource and analysis provide for the first time: (1) the correspondence of pathogen taxonomy with HTR classifications, which makes external/new pathogen(s) and specific infection feature(s) identifiable upon signature querying of the reference profiles in HTR Communities (e.g., the proteobacteria and oral commensal bacteria cases); (2) the common and specific HTR community gene expression patterns, which empower the elucidation on shared and distinct molecular mechanisms of host cells in confrontation with individual pathogen types (e.g., the Streptococcus case); (3) HTR categorization and differentiation of clinically related pathogens, which generate new biological hypotheses, and inform experimental validation and host-directed anti-infection therapies (e.g., the respiratory viruses case). If the total number of pathogens is N, and n of them are clustered in a community, and a bioprocess was considered to be significantly dysregulated in same direction in the infection of m of N pathogens, and k of them were in the target community, then the P value used to check whether the bioprocess was enriched in the target HTR community can be expressed as follows: The threshold for designation of a bioprocess being enriched within a community was P < 0.01.

Summary: In particular, we reported a slight modulation of type II IFN in PBMC exposed to INMI1 strain, but not to MR766, and a complete lack of type I/III IFN induction by both strains suggesting the ability of ZIKV to evade the IFN system not only inhibiting the antiviral IFN response [13] but also the IFN production. The lack of activation of type I and III IFN response in PBMC may reflect an escape mechanism from the innate immune defense, which may be exceeded by the presence of other acute-phase proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-9.

The Structure of SARS-CoV M pro in Complex with the Inhibitor N1 N1 binds to protomers A and B of SARS-CoV in an identical and normal manner. Although the intermediate remains to be unveiled, this could partially explain why N1 has a higher inactivation rate constant (k 3 ) against TGEV M pro than SARS-CoV M pro s. Second, another water molecule in the TGEV M pro complex occupies an equivalent position to the 189-Gln side chain, which interacts with the backbone NH of Leu at P2 in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 complex.

One advantage of using microarrays and NGS for pathogen discovery is that these same technologies can also be applied to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of newly identified novel agents.

A m8∆/pSFJ/SIVGag vector expressing the SIV Gag antigen under control of the pSFJ1-10 promoter generated significantly more Gag protein in vitro and elicited the production of anti-Gag IFN-γ + T-cells in mice, more efficiently than the non-replicating VV DIs strain (which harbors the gag gene under the control of the same promoter) [86] .

Title: Arapan-S: a fast and highly accurate whole-genome assembly software for viruses and small genomes 
Summary: The second category of assemblers is based on the de Bruijn graph, in which the nodes represent the substrings (k-mers) of the genomic reads (which are of the same length), while the edges correspond to the overlaps of these substrings. To our knowledge, there is no proof that the shortest or the longest path, or the Hamiltonian or Eulerian paths will represent the genome in its natural form; therefore, we developed an algorithm that selects only the reliable nodes in the de Bruijn graph in order to reconstruct the original sequence of small genomes or long contigs when the graph is sparse.

Title: PERSPECTIVE IMMUNOLOGY Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm in severe COVID-19 patients 
Summary: 2F -I), especially in ICU patients, suggesting the exhausted status in T cells in these patients infected To further identify the key pathogenic cytokines and the main source of these cytokines, interferon- (IFN-), TNF-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6 have been selected to be analyzed through intracellular cytokine staining, for these inflammatory mediators have been proven to be critical as the primary cause of inflammatory cytokine storm in patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 28, 29 . Thus, in COVID-19 patients, GM-CSF potentially links the severe pulmonary syndrome-initiating capacity of pathogenic Th1 cells (GM-CSF + IFN- + ) with the inflammatory signature of monocytes (CD14 + CD16 + with high expression of IL-6) and their progeny.

Summary: This suggests that in geographic regions known to be endemic for malaria, such as the Philippines, and in which high levels of HTLV-I antibody reactivity were reported, HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates are difficult to interpret, as it is difficult to rule out the possibility of cross-reactivity between HTLV-I/II and P. falciparum [25] . The hypothesis that HTLV-I/II WB seroindeterminates (or subsets of these individuals) may be related to prototype HTLV-I is further supported by the recent observations that demonstrated HTLV-I PCR positive results in 12.5% of HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates from Iran [17] (Table 1) .

Title: Viroporins, Examples of the Two-Stage Membrane Protein Folding Model 
Summary: An in silico analysis of the hydrophobic profile of viroporins using the ∆G Prediction Server [13] [14] [15] , an algorithm that predicts the presence of TM segments based on the apparent free energy difference (∆Gapp) for the insertion of a putative TM helix into the ER membrane by means of the Sec61 translocon, identifies for class I viroporins a single TM segment with highly favorable ∆G values (−3.59 kcal/mol in average ranging from -1.09 to -5.33 kcal/mol for the analyzed sequences) (Figures 1-3) . At this stage the protein sequence within the translocon will, depending on its characteristics, laterally partition into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (in the case of TM segments) [33] or, if the polypeptide region is not hydrophobic enough, continue through the channel to be translocated into the ER lumen.

Title: The ADRP domain from a virulent strain of infectious bronchitis virus is not sufficient to confer a pathogenic phenotype to the attenuated Beaudette strain 
Summary: To rule out other possible attenuating mutations within the Beaudette ADRP domain, the coding sequence of amino acid residues 1003-1171 of the IBV replicase protein, representing the complete IBV ADRP domain, were replaced with the corresponding M41 nucleotide sequence in both Beau-R and BeauR-M41 (S), generating rIBVs BeauR-M41-ADRP and BeauR-M41 (S)-M41-ADRP (Fig. The absence of IBV RNA in the tracheal cells isolated from chickens infected with the ADRP rIBVs, alongside comparable ciliary activities and clinical signs to Beau-R-and BeauR-M41(S)-infected chickens, demonstrates that neither the ADRP domain from M41, nor the serine to glycine repair is enough to restore pathogenicity to the apathogenic rIBVs Beau-R or BeauR-M41(S).

Title: Stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting by RNA G-quadruplex structures 
Summary: To better characterize RNA G4s as frameshifting signals, we systematically investigated the effect of total loop length as well as the orientation of the loop in À1 FS using the representative U-rich sequence in these loop regions. The +1 FS efficiency of the antizyme pseudoknot in the absence of spermidine is 2-3% (42), which is comparable with our G4-stimulated +1 FS We have also investigated the effect on À1 FS of several known G4 ligands.

Title: Attenuation of Mouse Hepatitis Virus by Deletion of the LLRKxGxKG Region of Nsp1 
Summary: Generation of the MHV-nsp1-27D mutant virus, with deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 To assess the role of the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 in the context of viral replication, we constructed a recombinant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, which encoded the MHV nsp1 with deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region (27 nts between nts 780-808) ( Figure 2 ). Thirdly, in pathological investigations designed to explore the importance of the LLRKxGxKG region for virus virulence in vivo, intraperitoneal infection of mice with MHV-A59 or MHV-nsp1-27D revealed that both viruses replicated in the spleen and liver, but that MHV-nsp1-27D titers were consistently lower than those of MHV-A59.

Title: Human Resources for Health The potential impact of the next influenza pandemic on a national primary care medical workforce 
Summary: Other parameters used in the modelling may also have been overly conservative, such as the extent of the healthy worker effect among doctors and the amount of time off work taken to care for sick relatives (which was zero in the baseline model and fairly small at 0.5 days in the "more severe" scenario). These include the following: • various international and national public health interventions (as recommended by WHO [1] ) may reduce the impact of pandemic influenza; • at least for subsequent pandemic waves, an appropriate vaccine may be available; • antivirals could prevent infection and reduce morbidity amongst the medical workforce and the rest of the population [23] ; • improved treatment could lower hospitalisation and mortality rates (relative to the figures used in this model).

Title: Therapeutic potential of the renin angiotensin system in ischaemic stroke 
Summary: The current evidence suggests that there is an imbalance in the RAS following stroke with an enhanced activation of the ACE/Ang II/AT 1 R pathway and that targeting the counter-regulatory ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis may provide protection. AT 2 R and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR form the 'alternative axis' and its activation is thought to counteract the detrimental effects induced by AT 1 R by leading to vasodilation, angiogenesis and preventing inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis contribute to increased stroke risk through a loss of this enhanced protective pathway.

Title: Viral Long-Term Evolutionary Strategies Favor Stability over Proliferation 
Summary: To better understand the role of correlated evolution and positive selection in the evolutionary dynamics of viruses infecting humans, we constructed a nearly exhaustive viral data set spanning all dsDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA, and ssDNA viruses deposited in GenBank (as of August 2017), and conducted an extensive survey of correlated evolution and diversifying selection in these viruses, asking more specifically about the prevalence of these two processes in each viral type, independently or jointly, with the specific hypothesis that the genes affected by both processes encode functions that are most critical to each viral life cycle. To assess the extent to which some of these differences at the gene level are functionally driven, we extracted the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, or GO terms, associated with the genes analyzed, as well as those under selection, correlated evolution, or both-focusing exclusively on the virus types for which we had the largest samples sizes, dsDNA and ssRNA viruses (Figure 1e) .

Title: Q&A: What are pathogens, and what have they done to and for us? 
Summary: It is sometimes assumed that the deadliest pathogens represent recent host jumps where the pathogens' virulence is maladapted to the new host, and that co-evolution between host and pathogen will lead to more benign symptoms over time. In the case of horizontal transmission, the situation is more complex and there is no straightforward way to predict the evolution of future virulence, as it will depend on a variety of factors, including the population structure of the host and the correlation between virulence and transmission [12] .

Title: Genetic Diversity and Phylodynamics of Avian Coronaviruses in Egyptian Wild Birds 
Summary: Since most of the ACoV positive wild birds were migratory and that Egypt has been proposed to be an important gateway in the Middle East and North of Africa for most of the emerging infectious diseases, it is likely that the mixing of birds and viruses from different hemispheres can lead to disease transmission. Thor and colleagues reported that the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within ACoV indicate a progressive evolutionary change that is the result of recombination events in the ACoV genome that play a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus, leading to the emergence of new IB genotypes and serotypes [38] .

Title: Modeling Heterogeneity in Direct Infectious Disease Transmission in a Compartmental Model 
Summary: Then, the probability of a susceptible individual escaping from being infected can be represented by the zero term of the NBD: Let the mean of the NBD be equal to the mean of the number of effective contacts of all susceptible individuals with infectious individuals, that is k m = βI N , where β denotes the transmission rate, defined as the per capita rate at which two specific individuals come into effective contact per unit time [22] ; I denotes the number of infectious individuals; and N denotes the size of the total population. The greatest difference is that at the overall level, the heterogeneity slows the transmission speed and decreases the peak sizes, which means milder disease outbreaks, because in the scenario with a high level of heterogeneity, only a small proportion of susceptible individuals have chances of coming into contact with infectious individuals and becoming infected, which results in a slower increase of the infected population.

Title: innate immunity to Respiratory infection in early Life 
Summary: Innate immunity in the lung in early life is influenced by acquisition of the microbiota, exposure to microbial products and other environmental factors, as well as the infant genome. In the neonatal murine lung, infection with the paramyxovirus Sendai virus results in a minimal early influx of neutrophils and low production of proinflammatory cytokines compared with the adult lung; similarly in murine RSV infection, early pro-inflammatory cytokine production is impaired (108, 115) .

Title: Identification of Peptide Inhibitors of Enveloped Viruses Using Support Vector Machine 
Summary: In view of the important role of E proteins in virus fusion process and common mechanism of action of self-derived peptides, we developed a SVM model to predict the antiviral activities of self-derived peptides using sequence-based statistical scores as input features. When the amino acid composition was used as input, the predictive accuracy of the EAPcompo model was higher than that of the AVPcompo model, indicating the peptide inhibitors of E proteins employed in the training set is sufficient to represent the contribution of amino acid composition to their inhibitive activities.

Title: Determining the dynamics of influenza transmission by age 
Summary: The estimator they obtain for the effective reproductive number for individual j on day t' is where n s denotes the number with symptom onset on day s and q s,t denotes the relative probability that case s was infected by case t. We propose the use of additional structure in this method to describe the probability of an infection event occurring between two cases that incorporates information on their ages by modifying the probability of transmission to be: where a j is the age group of individual j and w a i 0 a j is a measure of the likelihood of transmission between individuals in age group a i and a j . The results obtained using information on transmission dynamics from the study based in South Africa [12] as well as that of the PolyMod study [5] , appear to corroborate previous results for influenza pandemics [2, 3, 19] which seem to imply that school aged children are responsible for the bulk of disease transmission.

Title: Clinical and Molecular Allergy Novel concepts in virally induced asthma 
Summary: The importance of age at the time of virus peak was further strengthened by the fourth analysis which found that the age at which a child first presented with bronchiolitis symptoms had no bearing on the subsequent development of asthma; however, the age of the child in relationship to the peak of the viral season conferred an increased likelihood of developing high risk asthma. In any case, this study proposes that rhinovirus infection in early life may be causative for the subsequent development of asthma and that future studies examining the relationship between infant infections and asthma needs to include assays for the detection of rhinovirus and the inclusion of this virus in the data analysis [36] .

Title: Sugar-Binding Profiles of Chitin-Binding Lectins from the Hevein Family: A Comprehensive Study 
Summary: The overall strategy in this work of analyzing six chitin-binding lectins used the following three approaches: (1) binding affinities between the six lectins and a panel of PA-oligosaccharides were determined in terms of dissociation constant (K d ) by FAC and based on the FAC results; (2) their actual binding to immobilized glycans was analyzed using a glycoconjugate microarray, wherein 96 glycoconjugates consisting of serially glycosidase-treated glycoproteins and polymer-based multivalent synthetic glycans were immobilized; and (3) effects of desialylation were examined with a model serum glycoprotein, FET, on a lectin microarray platform, wherein 43 commercial lectins, including the six chitin-binding lectins, were immobilized. Although only LEL and WGA showed significant affinity for PA-chitotriose in the FAC analysis, STL, PWM, and UDA also showed significant binding to chitobiose-PAA (D24; 906 in Figure 3 ) on the microarray platform, though their binding was much weaker than LEL and WGA (Figure 7 ; for bar graph representation see Figure S1 ).

Title: Journal of Cardiovascular Disease Research OPEN ACCESS JCDR: Invited Review The Dual Role of TNF in Pulmonary Edema 
Summary: Although many diseases cause pulmonary edema, they do so by means of one or a combination of the following three processes: i) An increased capillary pressure in the lungs; ii) An increased permeability or disruption of the alveolar epithelial-endothelial barrier (permeability edema); iii) A dysregulated expression or function of crucial ion channels in type II alveolar epithelial cells (type II AEC) implicated in lung liquid clearance, such as the apically expressed epithelial sodium channel ENaC and the basolaterally expressed Na + /K + -ATPase. TNF-R1 is expressed in most tissues, and can be fully activated by both the membranebound and soluble trimeric forms of TNF, whereas TNF-R2 is found only in cells of the immune system, and respond to the membrane-bound form of the TNF homotrimer 75 .

Summary: All of the resistant contact Line 0 birds shed virus from the oropharynx followed, in 6/10 birds, by cloacal shedding, although this was always significantly lower than with infected C-B12 birds and over a shorter duration (Fig. 5) , in which case the Line 0 birds reversed the phenotype seen with intra-nasel infection and shed from the cloaca and not the oropharynx, suggesting that the limited shedding trajectories seen in Line 0 birds may be due to a restriction of within-animal transmission of virus.

Title: The Use of Convalescent Sera in Immune-Electron Microscopy to Detect Non-Suspected/New Viral Agents 
Summary: IAEM is more specific than other ns-EM methods, combining a morphological identification with antigen specificity, and it is more sensitive, making the identification of known and unknown viruses possible and easier, as well as improving the ability to locate viruses, especially under one of the following conditions: (a) when virions are pleomorphic and difficult to identify because they do not have a typical viral morphology, such as defined symmetry, presence and shape of spikes, particle size, and/or number and arrangement of capsomers; (b) when the viral concentration is low (this technique can provide a 10 2 -10 3 enrichment [2] ); or (c) when the samples are "dirty" because the aggregated complexes are more easily observed. ns-EM was confirmed as a very useful method for an initial diagnosis of viral enteritis and for the identification and screening of RVs, SRVs, AstVs and ELVs in avian intestinal and fecal samples because it is fast, can identify viruses that cannot be isolated or identified using other methods, and is also able to distinguish mixed infections and particles that are unable to replicate.

Summary: In agreement with previous studies that PEDV antigens of CV777 [21, 22] and the original US PEDV strain [10, 12] were detected in crypt cells, we found that infection of crypt cells by PEDV PC22A strain was observed in about 10% (5/53) of CDCD piglets and in one of 12 conventional sucking piglets. Therefore, the suckling piglets of sows F and G were most likely protected from PEDV diarrhea after challenge with high doses (1000 and 10 000 PDD 50 ) of virulent PEDV which were 10-100 times higher than the 100 PDD 50 that caused 100% diarrhea in piglets derived from PEDV-naïve sow E. The piglets were likely protected by PEDV-specific antibodies detected in the milk of PEDV-recovered sows ( Table 2 ).

Title: Monoclonal Antibody Combinations that Present Synergistic Neutralizing Activity: A Platform for Next-Generation Anti-Toxin Drugs 
Summary: Accordingly, the induction of neutralizing synergism might be explained by at least three putative mechanisms: first, the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites on the toxin; second, an increase in the affinity of the mixture of MAbs compared with each MAb component; and third, enhanced Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin complexes from the serum due to multimeric antibody decoration of the toxin. In this review, we described a body of evidence supporting three potential mechanisms underlying synergistic neutralization by MAb combinations: (1) the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites of the toxin, facilitating the significant blockade of two or more essential epitopes that react with the target cell, thus dramatically reducing the potency of the toxin; (2) a dramatic increase in the affinity of the combination of MAbs compared with each MAb component, correlating with neutralization; and (3) Fc-mediated clearance of antibody-toxin ICs from the serum, which is enhanced by the multimeric antibody Fc decoration of the toxin.

In addition to using virus-neutralizing human mAbs or peptides as a post-exposure therapeutic modality for HeV and NiV infection, a soluble virus receptor which binds G and prevents attachment of the virion to the host cell may also represent a feasible therapeutic strategy.

Title: Forecasting national and regional influenza- like illness for the USA 
Summary: Specifically, at each week during the CDC challenge, and for each of the ten HHS regions and the national, we find the past season that is most similar to the current data (based on the value of the Pearson correlation, calculated using all weeks of available data and typically found to have a Pearson correletion value that is > 0.9) and use the posterior distributions of that season as an informed prior for the current season. However, in the middle of the season, when there is greater variation in the historical data, the performance of the best mechanistic model variants was substantially better than that of the historical average model.

Summary: In terms of sample size, to detect a change in time to screening or isolation of at least 5 min per round (e.g., 11 min in round 1, 6 min in round 2, and 1 min in round 3), we required 10 clinic networks to participate in multiple rounds of the drill, assuming a two-sided test, alpha of .05, and power of 84% (adjusted from 80% due to 95.5% efficiency of nonparametric tests compared to parametric equivalent) [19] . In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct multiple rounds of drills (three rounds between April 2005 through December 2016) and assess time-based performance metrics (time to screening and time to isolation) in order to investigate the value of these drills in assessing, iteratively informing, and improving the emergency preparedness plans of community health centers.

The time delay in fusion may reflect the more stable nature of the HEF protein of ICV in a low-pH environment, which is demonstrated in our study (Fig.

Summary: Despite the strong mechanical strength of a pseudoknot, HIV-1 is rather unique in that it utilizes a simple stem-loop as its −1 PRF-stimulating element [20] , and, as described above, the −1 PRF efficiency is susceptible to mutations in the UUUUUUA frameshifting site (virtually from ∼5% to 0% for some point mutations) [4] . This gives rise to the interesting possibility that other than acting as a general mechanical hindrance, specific interactions between the pseudoknot and the mRNA entry site of the ribosome could promote −1 PRF by inducing conformational changes of the ribosome complex allosterically.

Summary: However, 5 influenza positive inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for more than one pathogen, including 4 dual-pathogen (influenza A + influenza B [2] , influenza A + rhinovirus, and influenza B + respiratory syncytial virus)  Of the 138 and 207 samples from community-ARI and inpatient-ARI episodes, 18 and 113 respectively were for influenza positive episodes (where multiple samples were collected for each episode). Also, non-influenza episodes in ARI severe enough to require hospitalization are more likely to also have a higher temperature than non-influenza episodes in mild ARI; this further reduces the ability of ILI case definitions to distinguish influenza from other respiratory causes in the inpatient setting.

Title: The Effect of School Closure on Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Transmission in Singapore: A Modeling Approach 
Summary: 2 This model assumes that the difference between the number of cases prior or after the public holidays is purely because of the difference in the number of infections happening on the public holiday, which is unobservable but indirectly represented by the change in the number of symptomatic cases in the following weeks. There was an estimated decrease of 7% in the number of cases in the week after a public holiday than the week before it, corresponding to a reduction in the number of infections that occurs on the holiday itself of 53%, although the effect of the holiday declines in the weeks following as infections return to baseline levels.

Title:  
Summary: The concepts of the management support system and the command response system can be found in the National Incident Management System that was standardized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US, in which 'Incident Management System' and 'Incident Command System' have been established in relation to public health risk response by infectious diseases in order to facilitate mediations between all levels of governments, including the Federal Government, state governments and local (city and county) governments, plus public, private and non-profit organizations [11] . Thus, the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act was revised, focusing on reform of infectious disease control system, supplementation of specialists in infectious diseases, preparation of measures to manage and oversee infection in hospitals, improvement of structure and culture of emergency centers, compensation of medical institutions and pharmacies for loss, compensation of patients and fatalities, and requests and disclosure of information at the time of any public health crisis caused by infectious diseases.

Title: Structure of mouse coronavirus spike protein complexed with receptor reveals mechanism for viral entry 
Summary: In summary, the unique features of receptor binding by MHV spike include the following: all of the three CEACAM21a-binding sites in MHV spike are readily accessible for the receptor and are fully occupied by CEACAM1a; receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike that weaken the interactions between S1 and S2; the orientation of bound receptor, which is perpendicular the spike in vitro, indicates potential bending of the receptor molecule in vivo. To investigate the role of CEACAM1a in the final conformational change of MHV spike, we collected negative-stain EM images of recombinant MHV S-e in the presence of recombinant CEACAM1a.

On the other hand, increased oxidative stress observed in ACE2-deficient mice may lead to the depletion of BH 4 [36] , a cofactor essential for the coupling of eNOS, and thereby shift the balance between • NO and • O 2 generation by eNOS to the favor of the second [37, 38] , further decreasing • NO levels and increasing ROS production in these mice.

On the one hand, wild canid populations may suffer severe epizootics and declines related to domestic dog diseases; on the other hand, there are species like jackals, coyotes and foxes that are highly adaptable to ecosystems and human-impacted environments and are reservoirs of several diseases of zoonotic or domestic animal importance including rabies, parvovirus infection, canine distemper and mange.

Summary: Sensitive strains are those susceptible to at least VRC01, 3BNC117, N6 and VRC13 with an IC 50 of less than 50 μg/ml.Based on these criteria, we identified a total of 19 broadly resistant strains and referred them as "Resistant panel to CD4bs bnAbs",including the nine selected here for more thorough analysis (CNE6, CNE23, CNE63, CNE64, CNE66, BJOX2000, BL01, TV1.29 and TZA125.17). In fact, the former was fully converted while the latter remained resistant to 3BNC117 (Table 2 , left column under 'Neutralizing activity').These results support the hypothesis that multiple mutations acted in concert to confer resistance,although the specific residues required and their contributions varied from strain to strain.It needs to be noted that a single N461A substitution was sufficient to improve the sensitivity or revert resistance for some of the clones carrying the mutation (CNE23, CNE63,CNE64, TV1.29 and TZA125.17).

Title: Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials Predicting the sensitivity and specificity of published real-time PCR assays 
Summary: This analysis must include the predicted false negative and false positive rates for the developed signatures, and consider all available public sequence data. Signatures within a given cluster are equivalent, in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets.

Title: BMC Public Health Beyond traditional surveillance: applying syndromic surveillance to developing settings -opportunities and challenges 
Summary: The revised IHR address the need for strengthening of disease surveillance by modifying disease lists to include syndromes for diseases of epidemic potential, and recommend the establishment of mechanisms for reporting outbreaks of major public health importance and the development of early warning surveillance systems. A meeting of the Pan American Health Organization on the Surveillance Network for Emerging Infectious Diseases in Amazon countries in 2005 recommended the development of early warning systems, adopting the syndromic approach to surveillance to heighten the sensitiv- ity of disease detection and improve clinical management of cases, such as the febrile icteric syndrome for yellow fever.

Title: Rotavirus C: prevalence in suckling piglets and development of virus-like particles to assess the influence of maternal immunity on the disease development 
Summary: In the indirect RVC VLP-based Ab ELISA, RVC milk IgA and IgG Ab titers were significantly higher (p = 0.0286 and p = 0.0251 respectively) in gilts/sows with healthy piglets compared with gilt/sows whose piglets were diarrheic ( Figures 4B and C) There were no significant differences in the titers of serum IgA and IgG Abs between the two groups ( Figures 4B and C) . Further, we used this ELISA to measure the levels of RVC IgA and IgG Abs in sow/gilt milk and serum samples and established that lower levels of milk IgA/IgG Abs were strongly associated with the development of clinical disease and the increased RVC shedding in piglets.

Title: A General Strategy to Endow Natural Fusion-protein- Derived Peptides with Potent Antiviral Activity 
Summary: Based on these data we decided to use a cell-to-cell fusion assay using cells co-expressing the envelope viral glycoproteins of HPIV3 ( Figure 2 ) and NiV ( Figure 3 ) which is our most stringent in vitro assay to evaluate peptide efficacy Figure 2 shows a comparison of the fusion inhibitory activity for HPIV3, of the cholesterol-tagged monomer HPIV-P3 and the cholesterol-tagged dimer HPIV-P4, derived from the same peptide sequence; for comparison, we also show the fusion inhibitory activity of the native, untagged peptide inhibitor HPIV-P2, and of a control peptide dimerized via a PEG 11 linker, HPIV-P5, similar to the one used by Welch et al. In this regard, we were facing the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of potency enhancement, since the native HRC peptide is already a potent fusion inhibitor, and the potency of the cholesterol-tagged peptide is in the picomolar range [38] .

Title: A simpler and more cost-effective peptide biosynthetic method using the truncated GST as carrier for epitope mapping 
Summary: Although the method has been used to reveal IgG-epitomes of three major proteins from human papillomavirus type 58 (HPV58) and in other related studies [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , it still had potential faults that needed to be overcome for convenience of users, which were: i) it is unable to purify the double enzyme-digested pXXGST-1 product with 4190 base pairs (bp), because it is only 6 bp shorter than the 4196 bp product generated by inadequate digestion leading to lower efficiency of constructing recombinant (r-) clones; and ii) setting GST188 control was required to screen the r-clone of expressing GST196 (GST188 + 8mer peptide) protein due to the~1 kDa of migration rate difference between both proteins, otherwise it is inconvenient to distinguish the~0.5 kDa difference between GST196 and GST192 (GST188 + 4 aa) proteins expressed by r-and self-ligation clones. The outstanding advantages of GST188-BSP method are as follows: i) using the truncated GST188 as carrier, it makes the expressed 8/18mer peptides fusion proteins in the weak antigenic area of bacterial proteins, and thus permits directly using them to map each BCE fine motif and epitome of target protein; ii) employing pXXGST-3 enables users to extract double enzymecut pXXGST-3 by running agarose gel electrophoresis, and thus greatly reduce the self-ligation of pXXGST-3 via removing products produced by inadequate digestion that may happened sometimes; iii) screening r-clones on the SDS-PAGE gels no longer needs any control, because as shown in lane 7 of Fig 3, there are no band similar to GST192 protein in the 21 to 30 kDa area of cell proteins, which will interfere with screening r-clones of 8mer peptide in the 21~30 kDa area for self-ligation of pXXGST-3; iv) employing thermo-inducible expression system instead of isopropyl-β-D -thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction reduces cost; v) it is less expensive than CSP method due to cheaper cost of oligonuleotide synthesis than peptides; vi) it is clearer and more credible for the blotted bands in Western blotting due to use of the ECL luminescence reagents than others such as 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) kit; vii) it is adaptable for most laboratories due to its relative simplicity.

Taking into account the deceleration ramp in our simulation, the time from the moment the nurse passes the doorway to the moment the door is half-closed is 8.45 s. In the paper of Choi and Edward, the time from the moment the human passes the doorway to the moment the AVM is measured, is 9.2 s. Thus, the time of influence of the wake is nearly the same in both simulations. In our case the nurse was moving against the movement of the opening door, and the effect of the passage was to reinforce the air migration.

Summary: However, our analysis using pknotsRG of the 13 new mesonivirus sequences and those of CavV, HanaV, NDiV, NseV and MenoV indicated that, although the slippery sequence (GGAUUUU) is completely conserved, the stem-loop structure predicted for NDiV is not predicted as the minimum free energy structure for any of the other viruses. The comparative analysis also revealed that the stemloop structure which had previously been identified at the RFS site of NDiV is not conserved in the other mesoniviruses and so may not be responsible for activating the −1 ribosomal frame shift.

There was a marked lack of fear and an appraisal of their risk of becoming infected that was minimal or very low: A few participants emphasized that their main fear at this time was not contracting Ebola, but rather the impact their decision would have on their families, and they were more preoccupied about this than their own personal safety: I got a letter from MSF asking for doctors, and immediately after I got the letter, I thought this is just exactly what I want to do.

Summary: Let the probability of susceptible individual i being infected by the only infector j in indoor environment l be p i,j,l , which can be expressed by the following equation [24] : where Q is the average number of infectious quanta generated by a infector (quanta/h); p is the pulmonary ventilation rate, and here we use 0.38 m 3 /h [25]; τ l is the duration of exposure to infection (h); and q l is the ventilation rate of the location (m 3 /h). This means that I t j and η j,l are independent, and hence the probability of individual i being infected by individual j in location l in the g th location group in day t, a t;g i;j;l , can be calculated as a t;g i;j;l ¼ P i;j;l Z j;l I t j : ð2Þ The visiting time of any individual to a given location is identical, according to the following equation: The probabilities of individual i being infected from different infectors in location l can be assumed to be independent.

Title: The changing phenotype of microglia from homeostasis to disease 
Summary: Kipnis even observed that both the suppressor and the effector activities of T cells could be mediated through dialogue with microglia in the condition of neurodegneration [135] , The entire scenario of crosstalk between T cells and microglia could be described as the following: microglia are initially activated by pathological stimuli during acute or chronic injury to the brain; if the activation occurs with the proper timing and mode and is well-controlled, the activated microglia will work as APCs [133] to stimulate Treg cells that eventually modulate the microglial activation directly or indirectly and affect the milieu balance between neurotrophism and cytotoxicity [44, 136, 137] . As the immuno-competent cells in the CNS, microglia are critical determinants of the outcome of injury, and the timing of microglial activation appears to be crucial to the outcome of the injury.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Negative Binomial Dispersion Parameter for Highly Overdispersed Data, with Applications to Infectious Diseases 
Summary: For a given n, estimation tends to be less biased (the median value of k is closer to k) and more precise (the IQRs of k are smaller) for larger values of m and smaller values of k. Numbers to the right of each subplot in Figure 1 show the coverage accuracy of the CIs estimated for k. The two numbers y/ z show, respectively, the percentage of simulations for which the true value of k fell below and above the estimated CI. That study reported that smaller sample sizes from NB datasets led to systematic underestimation of the mean and variance and overestimation of k; the variance/mean ratio was also biased downward by small n. There is one interesting difference between the method-of-moments estimates results of Gregory and Woolhouse [16] and the present results for ML estimation: the positive bias of k mom was fairly constant as m increased (though the range of k mom values was greatest for lower m), while the bias of ML estimates k decreased for higher m (Fig.

Title: Combining a Fusion Inhibitory Peptide Targeting the MERS-CoV S2 Protein HR1 Domain and a Neutralizing Antibody Specific for the S1 Protein Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) Showed Potent Synergism against Pseudotyped MERS-CoV with or without Mutations in RBD 
Summary: As shown in Table 3 , the resistance of MERS-CoV mutants to the neutralizing activity of m336 is about 2-to 8-fold, whereas the pseudoviruses with or without mutations were equally sensitive to fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. In this study, we compared the anti-MERS-CoV activity of HR2P-M2 alone and m336 alone with that of HR2P-M2/m336 in combination and found that the inhibitory activity of the HR2P-M2/m336 combination was significantly more potent than either one administered alone against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection, suggesting synergistic activity based on the dual mechanisms of action whereby HR2P-M2 targets the S2 subunit HR1 domain for inhibiting S2-mediated virus-cell or cell-cell fusion [5] and m336 targets the S1 subunit RBD for inhibiting virus-cell binding or virus attachment [10] .

Since TGF-b inhibited a-fibrinogen mRNA expression in HepG2 cells it is temptative to speculate that the activation of this cytokine in the early phases of liver injury could be responsible for the impairment in the circulating levels of the fibrinogen a C-chain fragment in patients with active hepatic fibrogenesis.

Title: An Overview of Practical Applications of Protein Disorder Prediction and Drive for Faster, More Accurate Predictions 
Summary: Furthermore, by using deep networks, maxout units and a dropout training procedure, our approach is capable of producing predictions that are on par with state-of-the-art methods in terms of balanced accuracy and Sw score (i.e., roughly the sum of the sensitivity and the specificity), but while making use of much less information (i.e., the input to WiDNdisorder consists solely of the protein's primary sequence in contrast to DNdisorder and DISOPRED, which use sequence-derived information, such as the output of PSI-BLAST). In the first stage (i.e., Tier 1), order/disorder predictions are made for each residue from the protein's primary sequence, and in the second stage (Tier 2), the initial prediction is refined using the predicted order/disorder state of neighboring residues as additional input to the prediction process.

Summary: All study participants confirmed through empirical examples the following situations that frequently occurred in Monrovia until the cemetery started its activities: -families calling the national hotline of the Ebola Task Force to activate the burial teams for picking up a body and not receiving any answer; -families waiting for burial teams for hours or even days, with dead bodies in the streets or indoors; -long waits for the non-Ebola certification in order to bury the non-Ebola bodies and consequent development of an informal market of certificates, quite expensive for the average local income; -several cases of non-Ebola deceased sent to cremation because of fear; -in the event of death, families were hesitant to involve the Ebola Task Force to remove the body since they knew that it would be sent to the Crematorium. Cremation of bodies and forced quarantine, as ways to quickly reduce transmission of Ebola outbreak for the benefit of the larger public, produced social dynamics of resistance in the same population that they wished to protect.

It is, however, our opinion that three specific efforts in Kenya; the establishment of the ZDU, One-Health workforce development including joint trainings for Veterinarians and Physicians through the FELTP program and the deliberate efforts to foster collaboration between institutions working on zoonosis have not only significantly accelerated the uptake and practice of One Health in Kenya, but have contributed to increased visibility of zoonotic diseases in Kenya and improvement of Kenya's preparedness against health threats of animal origin.

Summary: Using Ebola VLPs in a GLuc entry inhibition assay, which are thought to more closely mimic live EBOV in regards to eliciting immunological responses and protection [15, 23, 24] , we found that 3 survivors (ES-4, 8, and 10) were capable of neutralization (>50%) and one (ES-5) demonstrated borderline capacity to neutralize in both assays (50.40% and 49.91%) again using a serum dilution factor of 1:50. Four survivors (ES-4, 8, 12, and 13) were able to neutralize live virus using a PRNT, 2 of which (ES-4 and 8) demonstrated strong neutralization using the pseudovirus assay, as well as strong reactivity in 2 or 3 anti-EBOV IgG assays, using recombinant viral proteins.

Title: Detection of potentially novel paramyxovirus and coronavirus viral RNA in bats and rats in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam 
Summary: With bats suspected to be the main reservoir for more than 200 viral species, 248 bat samples from three different guano farms in the south of Viet Nam (Dong Thap Province) were screened for paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses to assess the potential risk to human health. Importantly, the screening of these samples by PCR alone may underestimate the prevalence of these viruses in the sampled populations, as detection is limited by the specificity of primers and the quality of samples collected using indirect methods such as that used for the collection of bat samples.

Title: Widespread Divergence of the CEACAM/PSG Genes in Vertebrates and Humans Suggests Sensitivity to Selection 
Summary: To verify that CEACAM homologs identified in lower taxonomy represent expressed genes, we analyzed the expression of select homologs in tissues of platypus, T. nigroviridis, and D. rerio using RT-PCR with gene-specific primers (Table S4 in File S1). Although the density of synonymous SNPs within CEACAM/PSG genes was similar to the average of other genes, the density of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes was significantly higher than that of the rest of genes on chromosome 19 (Table 1 , p,0.01).

Title: Forecasting the novel coronavirus COVID-19 
Summary: We believe that the significant forecast error at the end of the first forecast period (from 01/ 02/2020 to 10/20/2020) as depicted in Fig 2 could be the result of two factors: • While the forecasts that we produced using the data up until 31/01/2020 would be a good estimate in the scenario of "business-as-usual" (nothing changes), they disregard the fact that the world will act to get the virus under control. Our second and third sets of forecasts that cover the period 11/02/2020 to 01/03/2020 were very close to the recorded confirmed cases (the forecast error was lower than 6 thousand cases at the end of each 10-day period).

Title: Forensic genetics and genomics: Much more than just a human affair 
Summary: It is surprising that most of the life span of the discipline has been devoted to human genetics [e.g., 5], since a number of disagreements on questions intrinsically related to nonhuman materials always existed and, even when strictly human issues are at stake (such as the identification of a murderer), evidence from nonhuman sources can be crucial or are just the sole type of available evidence [e.g., 6]. This has been recognized by the first scientific journal explicitly devoted to forensic genetics (Forensic Science International: Genetics), when defining it as "The application of genetics to human and nonhuman material (in the sense of a science with the purpose of studying inherited characteristics for the analysis of inter-and intraspecific variations in populations) for the resolution of legal conflicts" [7] .

Title: Immune derangement occurs in patients with H7N9 avian influenza 
Summary: Significantly higher levels of serum cytokines in patients with H7N9 avian influenza SIRS is a consequence of cytokine storm, so we evaluated the levels of serum cytokines by CBA in HCs and in the patients with H7N9 influenza at the time of admission. We found that 70% of patients had at least two concurrent SIRS components and detected significantly higher levels of serum IL-6 and IL-8 in the patients than in HCs, which may explain the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.

Title: Inferring R 0 in emerging epidemics-the effect of common population structure is small 
Summary: The required control effort for the SEIR epidemic in a homogeneously mixing population is known to depend solely on R 0 through the relation [7, p. 69 ] Thus, we obtain an estimator of the required control effort in terms of observable growth rate and duration of the infectious period We compare the estimators (2.4) and (2.6) with other estimators that we obtain for different infectious contact structures, using the same values for the epidemic growth rate and duration of the infectious period. When the standard deviation of the infectious period is low, which is a realistic assumption for most emerging infectious diseases [23] , and R 0 is not much larger than 1, then ignoring the contact structure in the network model and using the simpler estimates based on homogeneous mixing results in a slight overestimation of R 0 and v c .

Summary: Since FCoV viremia can be detected by RT-PCR in up to 80-90% of FECV-infected cats without FIP [106] , detection of FCoV RNA in blood is not specific for FIP and RT-PCR in blood samples should not be used to confirm a diagnosis of FIP. All studies evaluating RT-PCR for the detection of FCoV RNA in CSF have reported specificities of 100%, meaning that FCoV RNA could only be detected in the CSF of cats with FIP (with and without neurological signs) but not control cats (Table 12) .

Considering the threats, particularly those associated with emerging zoonoses, evidence-based information should be provided and constantly updated for: (1) diagnostic tests to accurately classify the health status of individuals (2) the most effective preventative and therapeutic interventions (3) any emerging antimicrobial resistance and counter measures (4) public health strategies for population-based interventions In order to strengthen the health care system (health systems evidence), knowledge translation, exchange, and action are required by synthesis, dissemination, transfer, and uptake of knowledge in practice and decision making.

Title: Fiat Luc: Bioluminescence Imaging Reveals In Vivo Viral Replication Dynamics 
Summary: Once the reporter virus and imaging techniques are optimized, in vivo bioluminescence must be correlated with classical measures of viral load to establish the sensitivity of the system and determine whether light output quantitatively reports both sites of replication and viral titer. As luciferase is expressed by the animal, and the caged luciferin is activated by a viral enzyme in infected cells, this would obviate the need for production of specialized reporter viruses and allow this technology to be rapidly deployed with primary viral isolates.

Title: Experimental Cross-Species Infection of Common Marmosets by Titi Monkey Adenovirus 
Summary: In vivo infection of marmosets with a physiologic dose of TMAdV was unable to replicate the rapidly fatal pneumonia and hepatitis syndrome seen in some of the titi monkeys infected with the virus during the pneumonia outbreak at the CNPRC (Table 3 ) [6] , and necropsy tissues including lung, intestine, liver, were negative for TMAdV, albeit after complete resolution of clinical signs. The observed peak levels of neutralizing antibodies (1:16 to 1:32) in response to TMAdV infection in marmosets from the current study, as well as in rhesus monkeys, titi monkeys, and humans with mild/absent clinical signs or symptoms during the CNPRC outbreak, were significantly decreased relative to those in titi monkeys with fulminant pneumonia (up to .1:512) [6] .

Summary: This method of electrochemical HDA detection does not require the immobilization of the probe on the electrode; real-time isothermal HDA reactions with 48-electrochemical microwells can be performed in 1 h. Therefore, it has the potential to be a reliable method for sequence-specific DNA detection. Two enzymes are used in BAD-AMP: the DNA polymerase that replicates the DNA target on the beacon and the nicking endonuclease that cuts the replicated single strand at the recognition position.

Title: Glycyrrhizic Acid Promotes M1 Macrophage Polarization in Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages Associated with the Activation of JNK and NF-B 
Summary: As shown in Figure 5 (a), iNOS and Arg1 gene products were reciprocally regulated by the GA treatment, as follows: iNOS mRNA expression induced by GA was detectable by 3 h and increased to its peak at 6 h, whereas Arg1 mRNA was decreased by GA from basal levels to 30.64% of control at 24 h. As anticipated, we also observed that GA obviously enhanced iNOS protein expression in BMDMs in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5(b) ), and accordingly, the NO generation of GA-treated groups was significantly higher than those in the control groups ( Figure 5(c) ). We further analyzed the expression of M1-and M2related markers in BMDMs and found that GA significantly upregulated the expression of CCR7, TNF-, IL12, and IL-6, which are related to M1 macrophages, whereas GA downregulated the expression of M2-related markers MR and Ym1.

Title: A novel group of avian astroviruses from Neotropical passerine birds broaden the diversity and host range of Astroviridae 
Summary: The four novel astroviruses found in French Guiana substantially contribute to broaden the genetic and phylogenetic diversity of the genus Avastrovirus. Our proposal of two new Avastrovirus species is supported by the large between-group mean genetic distances in the amino acid sequences of ORF2 introduced by these viruses, with higher values for Avastrovirus 4 (astroviruses from Northern pintail) and Avastrovirus 5 (astroviruses from French Guianan passerines) than for the previously described species Avastrovirus 1, Avastrovirus 2 and Avastrovirus 3.

Title: A data-driven model for influenza transmission incorporating media effects 
Summary: We use a deterministic SEEIIR-M model (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered with media, with two compartments for exposed and infected individuals) to model the transmission of influenza under the influence of media effects:Ṡ = −βf (I)SI, (2.1) 3) where S, E 1 , E 2 , I 1 , I 2 and R represent the proportions of the population in each compartment, S + E 1 + E 2 + I 1 + I 2 + R = 1, β represents the effective transmission rate in the absence of media effects, 1/σ represents the average latent period, 1/γ represents the average infectious period and f (I) is the so-called media function which represents the reduction in transmission of the disease through the influence of mass media. It is further possible that any potential reduction in transmission in one season due to the effects of mass media could decrease pre-existing immunity for the next season, an effect which could be modelled by conditioning the media function on the total amount of media engagement from the previous season.

Summary: Briefly, for the adsorption assay, confluent Vero cells, pre-chilled at 4 °C for 1 h, were infected with 100 PFU of HSV-1 and treated with different concentrations of samples, then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The unabsorbed viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS, the cells were covered with overlay medium, the temperature was raised to 37 °C, and treated as described earlier for viral plaque number reduction assay. The relevant selectivity index of 15.33 of TSH fraction and its content (compounds 1 and 2) as well as the strong synergism effects observed suggest that the detected anti-HSV activity could be explained by the synergic effects of these major compounds present in the TSH fraction.

Summary: We describe an immunocompromised and severely ill patient with Legionnaires' disease and who also has allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides; he was successfully treated using tigecycline, a third generation glycylcycline, indicating that tigecycline may serve as a safe and effective alternative therapeutic option for treatment of Legionnaires' disease in select cases. Two prior case reports describe successful use of tigecycline in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with legionellosis; however, fluoroquinolones were used as initial therapy in both of these cases and tigecycline was later added to their antimicrobial regimen [6] [7] .

Title: Bacillus subtilis and surfactin inhibit the transmissible gastroenteritis virus from entering the intestinal epithelial cells 
Summary: Similarly, in the present study, we found that after stimulating with B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 for 1.5 h, the phosphorylation of EGFR and the expression of APN protein were both increased ( Figure 6 ), which indicated that B. subtilis might compete with TGEV for binding to the receptors at the surface of IPEC-J2 cells. And the depression of the percentage of apoptotic cells was better in the single treatment, where the TGEV did not exist, which might indicate that the TGEV could induce the apoptosis of this IPEC-J2 cells to some extent.

Title: Malaria vaccines: high-throughput tools for antigen discovery with development potential Vacunas contra la malaria: estrategias de alto rendimiento para el descubrimiento de antígenos con potencial para su desarrollo Epidemiological importance of malaria 
Summary: Availability of genomes from P. falciparum, P. vivax and from some other species, as well as progress in bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics, are permitting the development of high-performance methods to select, clone/synthesize, and analyze a large number of proteins of these parasites, and it is probable that it accelerates development of malaria vaccines. Preliminary studies suggest that a large number of antigens are recognized 30, 31 by the host's immune system, highlighting the importance of identifying the repertoire of antigens and epitopes from the different development phases of the parasite implied in induction of clinical immunity.

Over time, a decrease of both the viral titers and the presence of the negative-sense strand was observed in the treatment colonies.

Title: Transcriptome Analysis of the Initial Stage of Acute WSSV Infection Caused by Temperature Change 
Summary: The expression of both genes in Group WT at 12 hpi was nearly completely repressed, compared with that in Group T and Group W. These data further indicated that the inhibition of host cell proliferation was caused by WSSV; and the arrested state started at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection and lasted until 24 hptr at least when shrimp death began to occur. The expression of these three genes in Group WT at 12 hptr was significantly lower than that in Group T and Group W at 12 hptr (P,0.05), indicating that their expression had been repressed due to the rapid replication of WSSV.

The low prevalence of virus detection among preterm compared to term infants with acute bronchiolitis in this study could be attributed to other respiratory viruses which were not included in this study such as coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses, and may be also explained by the fact that only patients admitted with severe infections were included in our study.

Summary: To clone the EV71 2A protease with mutation of amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala for confocal microscopy analysis, the DNA template containing this mutation and primers (2A-S10 and 2A-AS3) was used to amplify the DNA fragment of full-length EV71 2A protein with mutation of amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala. After the PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by the restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI), and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (Invitrogen, USA) which had been linearized with EcoRI/XbaI. The same approach was used to clone the DNA fragment encoding the C-terminus of EV71 VP1 and 2A protease deleting the amino acids 146-149 with the V5 tag in the C-terminus using primers (VP1/ 2A-S and 2A-AS301) to perform PCR.

Title: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Induces PD-L1 Expression on Antigen- Presenting Cells via Autocrine and Paracrine Interleukin-STAT3 Circuits OPEN 
Summary: 2A , the positive control lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was able to significantly increase PD-L1 expression on both cell types (p < 0.0001), with a striking >10 fold increase in macrophages at 48 h. Upon infection with BCG, both APC types expressed high levels of PD-L1 compared to the unstimulated control at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.0001), and a dose trend was observed for increasing MOI in macrophages at 48 h. Next, a transgenic strain of BCG that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to determine whether the up-regulation of PD-L1 depended on direct interaction between APCs and the bacteria. With the hypothesis that BCG was inducing STAT3-activating cytokines to up-regulate PD-L1, we treated DCs and macrophages with different concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 and measured PD-L1 up-regulation by flow cytometry.

Title: Arterivirus nsp12 versus the coronavirus nsp16 29-O-methyltransferase: comparison of the C-terminal cleavage products of two nidovirus pp1ab polyproteins 
Summary: The 39-terminal domain of the most conserved ORF1b in three of the four families of the order Nidovirales (except for the family Arteriviridae) encodes a (putative) 29-O-methyltransferase (29-O-MTase), known as non structural protein (nsp) 16 in the family Coronaviridae and implicated in methylation of the 59 cap structure of nidoviral mRNAs. The fact that EAV does not tolerate substitution of its single invariant nsp12 residue stands in remarkable contrast to phenotypes described for mutants of the invariant residues of the NendoU or 29-O-MTase of nidoviruses (Kang et al., 2007; Menachery et al., 2014; Posthuma et al., 2006; Züst et al., 2011) , which are both more strongly conserved than nsp12.

Title: Staphylococcus aureus colonization and non-influenza respiratory viruses: Interactions and synergism mechanisms 
Summary: The role of interactions between viruses and bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections have been extensively studied in the literature and notably those between influenza viruses and S. aureus or S. pneumoniae [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . RSV is supposed to exacerbate S. aureus co-infection via at least two mechanisms: enhancing the adhesion of S. aureus to the RSV-infected cells [88, 89] , and decreasing the bacterial clearance by altering the immune response to S. aureus [87, 90] .

Title: Homology-Independent Metrics for Comparative Genomics 
Summary: Comparative genomics using HI metrics may better reflect the global phylogenetic relationships between complete genomes by considering, for instance, events of horizontal transfer (HGT, one of the many factors known to change local frequencies of nucleotide words in genomic sequences) as part of the evolutionary signal in opposition to the reductionist analysis of single genes as proxies to faithfully represent the phylogenetic history of the entire genome. Observed values are the counts of the jth codon for the ith amino acid, and expected values are calculated by counting the total of codons encoding the amino acid i in a given sequence divided by the degeneracy class of amino acid i (two, three, four or six).

Title: Supplementary material: The persistence of multiple strains of avian influenza in live bird markets Model flow chart parameters and state variables n SS n SE 
Summary: The within flock component of R 0 (R wf 0 ) for the SEIR single strain model in the absence of environmental transmission is as follows: Firstly, we need to account for the probability that birds make it through each of the 4 E compartments without being sold, and thus progress to the infectious state. Starting with only one bird in the E state, zero birds in the I, a wholly susceptible population and a clean environment, we can calculate the amount of time spent infected by solving the following: Equations 31 and 32 can be solved analytically to give: We can then assess how many virions are excreted by this single infected bird by solving: This can be solved analytically (again under the assumption of a 1 compartment model) to give: Knowing the number of virions in the environment over time, we can calculate the probability of a bird becoming infected as follows: under the assumption that the number of virions from a single bird is very small (V 1 ψ), we can make some simplifying assumptions: and hence using the Taylor expansion, (where e x ≈ 1 +x for small x) we obtain: We can therefore calculate the total number of environmental transmissions as follows: Therefore by extension if we then consider the four compartmental model (as assumed throughout the manuscript) the environmental R 0 is proportional to the time spent secreting virus, hence R env 0 is: Where the first term considers the probability that a bird makes it to the I state while still in the market.

Title: Effect of Host Species on the Distribution of Mutational Fitness Effects for an RNA Virus 
Summary: One of the most striking conclusions from our study is that the fraction of lethal, deleterious, neutral and beneficial mutations, and hence the shape and location of the distributions, radically depends on the host in which the fitness effects of mutations is evaluated, and that this dependence is, itself, conditioned by the phylogenetic distance among hosts. The significant positive pleiotropy observed between absolute fitness in the natural host N. tabacum and in two closely related alternative ones (N. benthamiana and D. stramonium) suggests that mutations ameliorate aspects of the virus interaction with host factors that may be common to all three hosts but not to the other hosts.

Considering that these BRSV strains were obtained from BRD-affected animals and based on i) the circulation of distinct lineages of BRSV strains in a single herd at the same time, ii) the changes in the immunodominant region of G protein, and iii) the negative results for the other respiratory tract pathogens, we presume that infection with related but distinct BRSV strains may favor immune evasion by the virus, establishment of infection, and eventually, disease induction, even if these strains are or are not attenuated strains.

Summary: We interviewed key informants about their experience of and reflections on the emergency management of the SARS and H7N9 events, with the same questions about the impacts on health, society, and economy of SARS and H7N9. Although there were rumors that people could be infected with H7N9 from eating chicken and that pickled peppers and onions can prevent H7N9 [25] , compared with SARS, the H7N9 epidemic did not lead to large-scale social panic, and the management of the problem satisfied both the Chinese and international community, as mentioned by one media journalist and one CDC expert satisfaction with the government's prevention and control of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza, thought that the government announced the information regarding the epidemic situation in a timely manner, expressed satisfaction with the government's release of information about prevention and control measures, and felt confident in the government's ability to fully control the epidemic, as mentioned by a community resident: As we could know the information of H7N9 by TV, newspaper, internet, it was clearer for us to know the dangers of H7N9 than SARS.

Title: Cough aerosol in healthy participants: fundamental knowledge to optimize droplet-spread infectious respiratory disease management Cough aerosol in healthy participants: fundamental knowledge to optimize droplet-spread infectious respiratory disease management 
Summary: Major findings in this study include: a) the respiratory system generates droplets of many different sizes during coughing; b) droplets smaller than ten-microns account for up to 99% of the total number of droplets that are expelled as a bioaerosol during coughing; c) due to its size distribution and amount, the cough bioaerosol has the potential to contribute directly, indirectly and/or through airborne route to the transmission of respiratory infections, including Influenza A caused by the H1N1 virus; d) age, sex, weight, height and corporal mass have no effect on the size and number of emitted droplets; e) our approach has the potential to identify high emitters and/or outliers; f) these results create a foundation for the development of a standardized human cough aerosol model; g) the acquired data creates a foundation for the development of tools in airway hygiene for secretion management, as well as in prevention of droplet-spread illnesses. Based on the results obtained in this study we are confident that we have achieved a strategic and critical step towards optimizing management of droplet-spread epidemic-prone infectious diseases in the form of a detailed real-time characterization of the cough aerosol regarding the size and, more importantly, the number of droplets expelled when coughing.

In other words, the UGFM-TGCC-SCG tool can not only handle the exceptional situations for a large set of genomes, but also facilitate the effective integration of the Mauve program into performing the so-called systematic comparative genomics among a large set of genome sequences crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) and diverse biological categories (bacteria, archaeal bacteria, and viruses) with far divergence (less or no homology) over large size range (e.g., 6 Kbp,4 Mbp) (Figure 6, 7) .

Title: molecules Fluorescence-Based Multiplex Protein Detection Using Optically Encoded Microbeads 
Summary: One of main advantages of combining fluorescence-based protein detection with SERS-encoded beads is that the target binding event and the type of ligand can be simultaneously recognized by fluorescence and SERS, respectively, with single laser-line excitation and without interference by coding number. Therefore, SERS-coded beads can be one of the best candidate methods for bead-based protein detection, and combination of SERS and fluorescence is likely to be useful for multiple protein detection.

Title: Anti-inflammatory effect of torilidis fructus ethanol extract through inhibition of Src 
Summary: To confirm that the suppression of NF-jB activity by Tf-EE also led to the blocking of NF-jB translocation, levels of nuclear p65 and p50, which compose NF-jB, were determined by nuclear fractionation and immunoblotting analysis from lysates obtained 15 min after treatment with LPS in the presence of Tf-EE. Since the level of p-Src was not affected by Tf-EE (Figure 3(C) ), further investigation determined the levels of p-Src under the presence of Flag-MyD88, which directly stimulates activation of Src, in transfected HEK293T cells to confirm that Tf-EE targeted Src as part of its anti-inflammatory response.

Title: Lycorine reduces mortality of human enterovirus 71-infected mice by inhibiting virus replication 
Summary: Consistent with the results of the clinical scores and survival rates, virus replication in the muscle of lycorine-treated mice were inhibited by 10-100 folds at different time points compared to that of the saline control as detected by qRT-PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR ( Figure 5A and 5B). This assumption was verified by evaluating the antiviral effect of lycorine in a mouse model, as the survival rate of 0.4 mg/kg lycorine-treated mice was significantly enhanced compared to the control mice upon lethal EV71 infection ( Figure 4A) , and the alleviation of acute symptoms and reduction of pathological changes in the muscles of lycorine-treated mice were achieved by inhibiting the replication of virus (Figure 4, 5, 6 ).

Summary: Under higher magnification of the subchondral bone region where edema was shown in MRI images, remarkable necrotic changes were observed in emu after induction, including 1) avascular zone at load bearing region, referring to the blood vessels quantification within the collapsed region; 2) extravascular adipogenesis (fat cell enlargement); 3) apoptosis of osteocytes in regions next to the marrow region packed with fat cells; and 4) thinning of subchondral bone, poor quality of bone matrix and more osteolacunae that weakens the mechanical integrity of the femoral head, which could also be weakened by the necrosis and thinning of articular cartilage. On the contrary, our micro-CT evaluation for the central region of the femoral head, where no bone structural collapse was demonstrated, implied that the pulsed LPS-MPS induction protocol did not result in general osteoporosis as no difference in boney structural and BMD was found between SAON emus and normal controls in regions away from the subchondral bone.

Title: Estimating Sensitivity of Laboratory Testing for Influenza in Canada through Modelling

The overall model fit, and the general consistency of the sensitivity estimates, suggests that these many respiratory viruses were reasonably accounted for by the seasonal baseline and that the strong association between the number of influenza positive and influenza negative tests on a weekly basis is indicative of a significant number of false negative results, rather than the activity of another virus or viruses exactly synchronous with influenza.

Summary: The results showed that 74% of nurses preferred the third schedule for the following reasons: (1) putting on and taking off PPE twice a day increased medical resource consumption; (2) frequently moving between contaminated and clean areas increased the risk of infection; (3) frequently going through the complicated procedures of putting on and taking off PPE increased their mental burden; (4) working for 6 h continuously pushed their physiological limits, as they could not go to the bathroom when wearing PPE in the isolation area, and they often felt groggy or tired at the end of work; and (5) having 1 h of overlap between shifts provided flexibility and facilitated the handover, which reduced nurses' mental stress and the possibility of adverse events. To relieve the mental stress of nurses, the head nurse has a 30-min meeting with nurses who will work in the isolation area on the next day to make them aware of the adequate equipment and resources in our hospital, the observers who will send instant aid if necessary, etc.

Title: Evidence of Recombination and Genetic Diversity in Human Rhinoviruses in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection 
Summary: The nucleotide sequences in the 59UTR of these strains were related closely to those of formerly identified QPM, NAT001, NAT045, C024, C025 and C026 HRV-C strains, and to some of the W strains recently identified as HRV-A [15] (Fig. Comparative analysis of the full-length nucleotide sequences of two field strains of different HRV-C subspecies (N4 and N10) with those of other HRV species suggested that multiple interspecies recombination events occurred in the 59UTR and in the NS2A protein gene, and that recombination also occurred in the 39UTR between N4 and a strain close to N10.

Title: Estimating Individual and Household Reproduction Numbers in an Emerging Epidemic 
Summary: More specifically, the model assumptions are that: N individuals are distributed into households, and mix randomly and homogeneously outside of their household; N within a small time interval d, an individual who has been infected a time t ago infects a person at random in the population with probability b G (t )d; N within this same time interval he or she infects each susceptible individual in his or her household with probability b L (t, n)d (this is allowed to depend on the household size n, since empirical evidence suggests such variation may occur [10] ); N the population is large, and the disease has low prevalence, so that the probability of a household being repeatedly infected is negligible; N the functions b G (t ) and b L (t, n ) are proportional to each other as functions of the time since infection t. As a result of the last assumption and of the discussion around equation (6), the infectiousness functions can be decomposed as b G (t) = R G w (t) and b n (n, t) = r n w (t), where R G is the average number of people each infected individual infects through random (non-household) contacts, w (t) is the generation time distribution for between household transmission, and r n is a parameter describing infection within the household whose interpretation will be clarified below. Using the notation defined earlier, I define the state vector X = {n, m 1 , …, m n } of variables which define the infectiousness and susceptibility of the infected household, where n is the household size and m i is the number of infected individuals in the i th generation of infection in the household.

Shotgun metagenomics results were concordant with standard microbiological testing results in 4 of 5 known etiology cases; rubella virus was detected in the idiopathic case, which was in agreement with the patients' medical history A second study from the same group included specimens that were PCR-negative (n = 36) or PCR-positive (n = 31) for several pathogens (herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, varicellazoster virus and Toxoplasma gondii) and evaluated the use of shotgun metagenomics for pathogen detection [131] .

Title: BMC Infectious Diseases The United States and Canada as a coupled epidemiological system: An example from hepatitis A 
Summary: The rate at which a susceptible person is infected due to travel in endemic countries ( ), and the rate at which a susceptible person is infected by infectious persons due to domestic US transmission ( ) were computed simultaneously using: (1) published data on the true incidence of hepatitis A in the US, adjusted for under-reporting and the probability of jaundice [8] , (2) data on the age-specific proportion of cases attributable to travel in endemic countries [13] , and (3) an assumed form for a "Who Acquires Infection From Whom" matrix consisting of the parameters [31] . As the annual volume of travel by Canadian residents to the US increases, the adjusted incidence in Canada also Adjusted incidence by age classes in the US (top) and Canada (bottom) upon initiation of a universal vaccination pro-gramme in the US at 70% coverage in all age classes in 1995 Adjusted incidence in Canada versus US vaccination coverage (in the 0-4 age class), at the equilibrium state of the model dynamics Figure 3 Adjusted incidence in Canada versus US vaccination coverage (in the 0-4 age class), at the equilibrium state of the model dynamics.

Title:  
Summary: Interestingly, a UCC_U tetranucleotide is the site of þ1 frameshifting in antizyme expression, although here frameshifting is stimulated, in part, by the presence of a stop codon in the A-site (a role that is unlikely to be substituted by a UUU codon in the A-site) [3] . At the influenza PA-X shift site, P-site slippage on the UUU_C tetranucleotide may be stimulated by the rare CGU codon in the A-site (CGU is one of the most seldom-used codons in the genomes of mammals and birds-the host species of influenza A virus; table 1 [35] ).

The sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks means that the commercial development of NiV vaccines for use in pigs (other livestock or humans) is limited and animal health companies are of the opinion that NiV vaccines will have limited marketability.

The caveat that we see in this method is that by estimating the effective reproductive number with the methodology of [7] (WT) there is an over fit of this parameter and it essentially traces the epidemic curve, lagged by the mean of the serial interval.

Most prominent were varying levels of concern about (1) the lack of consent from the parents to use WGS on the isolates collected from the dead neonates for the purposes of conducting an epidemiological investigation; (2) the confidentiality of information elicited through testing and strain typing isolates taken from other patients, parents and/or staff members; and (3) the impact on a staff member or parent if they were found to be the source of the pathogen.

Summary: HCoV-NL63 causes disease in children, the elderly and the immunocompromised, and has been detected in 1.0-9.3% of respiratory tract infections in children. A recent study, however, reported that for all four circulating HCoVs combined, the detection fre quency in samples from patients with URTIs and LRTIs exceeds the proportion seen with samples taken from patients with no respiratory symptoms; this provides epidemiological evidence for the role of HCoVs in the etiology of respiratory disease [55] .

Since the pattern of cytokine production in each group treated with L. acidophilus strains was similar regardless of SlpA-mutation or co-expression of IL-1β, those responses were likely attributed to the nature of the S-layer protein, per se.

Summary: Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of panther FeLV gene sequences and those from known domestic cat FeLV strains revealed three important aspects: (1) The panther FeLV was clearly aligned with FeLV domestic cat type FeLV-A, the strain that is largely avirulent until after recombination with endogenous sequences; (2) There was no evidence of endogenous FeLV sequences within in the panther FeLV; and (3) The panther FeLV was closely aligned with a highly virulent FeLV from domestic cats, FeLV-945. Early attempts to characterize the genetics, epidemiology and pathogenicity of feline viruses established the following accepted paradigms in viral disease: that fatal FIP resulted from a simple single mutation from the benign FCoV; that FIV was host-adapted and innocuous in non-domestic felids; and that FeLV-related disease could only occur in species within the domestic cat lineage and always resulted from recombination with endogenous FeLV.

Summary: Judging by the nature of the divalent antibody and the trimeric HA, and because the HA variations of different strains occur mainly in the HA1 domain, which binds to the host receptor, to investigate the kinetic profile of 32D6 binding to HA, the His-tagged Fab of 32D6 (with the C H 1 domain) and HA1 of A/California/07/2009 (residues 63-290) were each expressed in human Expi293F cells and were purified. Based on the HA1 domain, superimposition of this complex onto an HA trimer model indicates that the 32D6-Fab is not blocked from binding to the HA1 domain in the trimer via the same mode as observed in the Figure 2 .

Title: Epidemic spreading in multiplex networks influenced by opinion exchanges on vaccination 
Summary: On the other hand, for an efficiency close to one, the opinion of the system is in average almost completely in favor of the vaccine, reaching a consensus where all the agents have the same opinion. For this purpose we used two-layer network where in one layer we use the SIR-model with vaccination for the propagation of a disease, and in the other layer we used the M-model (with M = 2), for the opinion formation process, where compromise and persuasion are the two processes involved and are controlled by the parameter r. We found that, in all the cases, the number of recovered agents decreases as ω increases, and this is due to the fact that as the vaccine becomes more effective, more people remain vaccinated and the propagation of the disease slows down.

Title: Diagnostics of rare disorders: whole-exome sequencing deciphering locus heterogeneity in telomere biology disorders 
Summary: In three patients and a brother of one of the patients presenting with varied characteristics of immunological or hematological disorders, we identified monogenic variants in genes associated with TBDs, and supported the genotype-phenotype correlation by demonstrating shortened blood cell telomere length. Due to the identification of variants in genes associated with defective telomere function, we analyzed the length of the telomeres in the four patients.

Title: Frequent detection of Saffold cardiovirus in adenoids 
Summary: In every case of the 11 SAFV-positive adenoid samples, classical respiratory viruses were also found (Table 1) , with Enterovirus being the most frequent one (n = 9, 81.8%) followed by Human bocavirus (n = 7, 63.6%) and one of the four Human parainfluenza viruses (n = 5; 45%). The hypothesis of a higher SAFV prevalence in adenoid tissue than in non-tissue specimens from the respiratory tract might be underpinned by our results detecting SAFV in 15.7% of adenoid tissue samples vs. 4.4% in throat swabs, although the difference was not statistical significant (p = 0.059), most probably due to the low numbers analyzed.

Title: Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea 
Summary: These bacteria were mostly present in the intestinal lumen, however, in 20 % of diarrheic and 30 % of non-diarrheic animals the bacteria were found within the mucus layer and in direct contact with the intestinal epithelium. In agreement with this, the presence of C. perfringens in close proximity to the mucosal surface was seen in similar prevalence in both groups of piglets in this study (20 % diarrheic vs. 30 % non-diarrheic) and did not correlate with histological lesions, suggesting that the localization of C. perfringens cells in the intestinal mucosa is not linked to its pathogenicity.

Title: Increasing the number of available ranks in virus taxonomy from five to ten and adopting the Baltimore classes as taxa at the basal rank 
Summary: Now, with the large-scale discovery of viruses in diverse hosts and habitats through genome sequencing, and the increased sophistication of computational methods for the quantification of phylogenetic relationships, it is becoming increasingly evident that the ICTV taxonomy rank structure is insufficient to accommodate properly the emerging scale of virus diversity and the complexity of virus phylogeny. Below, I list several arguments in favor of adopting an expanded version of the rank structure of the modern Linnaean taxonomy for virus taxonomy and adoption of the Baltimore groupings in the rank of domain, which might be seen as a revival of the idea put forward by Lwoff, Turnier, and Horne [21] .

Title: A Multiple siRNA-Based Anti-HIV/SHIV Microbicide Shows Protection in Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models 
Summary: In contrast to the HEK-293 cell study, human PBMC cultures grown in 12-well plates were incubated with a single dose (1 μg/1million cells) with psiRNA cocktail with CNs (psicocktail) or pU6 vector control-CNs (pU6.con) or CNs alone without any plasmids (Virus) and then infected with HIV-89.6 (final concentration of 15 pg/ml) for 2-3 h. The virus was removed 2 h after the infection by centrifugation, the cells washed and fresh medium was added. The results suggested that administration of the cocktail of plasmid siRNAs complexed with CNs significantly reduced the virus titer (as measured by p24 ELSIA in pg/ml) by day 3, while in the pU6 control, the virus titer had plateaued at days 2, and 3 ( Fig 5) .

Summary: In this study, we used five years of data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2-14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Though we found significantly increased odds for association of several clinical signs and symptoms with testing dengue-positive, these increases were more modest for the early phase of illness compared to the course of illness, suggesting that caution should be taken when using the results from the entire course of illness to develop prediction algorithms.

As an alternative to using a computationally burdensome approach of re-estimating the regression equations, a modeler may choose to use a certain decay factor α n [76] to adjust the estimates of the regional impact measures at every nth outbreak epoch, in the following way: In addition, we use the following regression model to estimate the probability of pandemic spread from affected region l to unaffected region k, as a function of resources allocated to region l, which, in turn, impact the number of outgoing infectious travelers from the region: where γ i ·· denotes the regression coefficient associated with resource i, γ im ·· is the regression coefficient associated with interaction between resources i and m, and γ 0 ·· represents the intercept.

Summary: We also considered the following CDA components, when related to the index outpatient visit: 1) a subset of the ARI ICD-9 codes whose narrative included the string ''pneumonia'' (''Pneumonia ICD-9 codes'': 480-483, 485-487); 2) a new prescription for antibiotics of a class of commonly used to treat pneumonia (cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillins); 3) admission to the hospital, for any reason, within 48 hours of the index outpatient visit (''(Not) Admitted to Hospital''); 4) chest imaging performed (''Imaging Obtained''); 5) whether at least one chest imaging report related to the index visit was labeled ''non-negative'' by the automated text classifier described above (''Text of Imaging Reports''). With the possible exception is CDA 7, whose Fmeasure was the highest achieved in this study, the OR Text of Clinical Notes component did not add further value to CDAs that already included analyses of the chest imaging reports (compare CDA 7 to 5 and 14 to 12, Table 3 ; CDA 21 to 19 and 28 to 26, Table 4 ; CDA 35 to 33, Table 5 ).

Title: Persistent digestive disorders in the tropics: causative infectious pathogens and reference diagnostic tests 
Summary: However, the integration of such multiplex PCR assays into routine testing of clinical samples remains restricted to well-equipped laboratories, and hence, these molecular techniques are only rarely available in endemic settings in the tropics. Additionally, such investigations will optimise the use of existing diagnostic tests and advance the development of new methods, which are ideally able to concurrently detect a broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens with a high sensitivity and specificity, and which are simple and affordable enough to be performed in lowincome countries where prevalences of persistent digestive disorders are generally high.

The outline follows the temporal sequence of presentations. This paper (Part 3) presents a section regarding Moving Across the Spectrum of Care for Long-Term Ventilation (Moving Across the Spectrum of Care for Long-Term Ventilation, New Indications for Non-Invasive Ventilation, Elective Ventilation in Respiratory Failure -Can you Prevent ICU Care in Patients with COPD?, Weaning in Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals in the United States, The Difficult-to-Wean Patient: Comprehensive management, Telemonitoring in Ventilator-Dependent Patients, Ethics and Palliative Care in Critically-Ill Respiratory Patients, and Ethics and Palliative Care in Ventilator-Dependent Patients) 
Summary: In conclusion, for respiratory patients with EOL issues we need to: Offer the best practice to ameliorate the pervasive effects of the disease Recognition that medication alone is insufficient to achieve optimal outcome Control the often overwhelming symptoms (such as dyspnoea) and psychological symptoms Focus our care on our patient and the family Allow for and foster a continuous presence of family, friends and religious assistance Give time and place to our patient to say everyone "good bye" Talk to our patients and relatives using their language Listen to our patients and their families and caregivers Consider patients' preferences Not unduly prolong suffering to maintain life in some EOL situations Consider hospice and "palliative care" as opportunities for our patients Ethics and palliative care in ventilator dependent patients (Guido Vagheggini, Nicolino Ambrosino) The care of end-stage patients requires a progressive reduction of useless and "futile" treatments and an increasing approach to relieve of symptoms Clinicians are involved in surrogate or joint decision making Patient centered supportive care should respect patients' values and preferences Physicians and healthcare professionals are challenged by prognostic accuracy of patient survival. In these patients, the transition from the usual to the palliative and end of life care cannot be a step down, but should start simultaneously to the care, as soon as needed, and last until and after the death to ensure appropriate support to the family.

Summary: Instead of appending all the gene sequences from the HEVs and then building a phylogeny based on such artificial sequences, which could be highly sensitive to weighting factors for different genes, we use information more intrinsic to individual HEV genomes to construct the phylogeny. The basic idea of the genomic barcode is to represent a genome using a two-dimensional array with the row representing the genome axis contracted by N fold, the column representing the axis of all k-mers for a fixed k (1,k,7), arranged in alphabetical order, and the value at row i and column j is the frequency of the i th k-mer within the window from base-pair j*N + 1 to base-pair (j+1)*N, with N being the window size (the default values of the barcode program [29] are k = 4 and N = 1,000 base-pairs (bps) but can be adjusted by the user).

Summary: As MERS-CoV infection is a rare event, the risks of at least one infection in the travellers from each region were determined from the Poisson distribution parameterised by the expected number of cases during the Hajj period and throughout the year for Umrah [8] . As the incubation period has been estimated to be shorter than the total length of stay of Hajj pilgrims and longer than the length of stay of Umrah pilgrims in KSA, it is likely that most infections during the Hajj will have onset while still in KSA, while any infected Umrah cases are more likely to present in their home countries.

Title: NMR and MD Studies Reveal That the Isolated Dengue NS3 Protease Is an Intrinsically Disordered Chymotrypsin Fold Which Absolutely Requests NS2B for Correct Folding and Functional Dynamics 
Summary: The conformation and activity of the refolded NS3pro in complex with NS2B (48-100;Δ77-84) Although residues Thr77-Met84 are missing in all crystal structures of the open form, they were revealed by MD simulations to play a key role in coordinating the correlated motions with the NS3pro residues. As such, the MD results not only rationalizes the central role of the NS2B cofactor in maintaining the dynamic stability of the NS3pro domain, but further implies that a slight perturbation of the NS2B-NS3pro interface may be sufficient to decouple the correlation network to inactive the catalytic machinery of the dengue NS2B-NS3pro protease, as we found on the N214A mutation of the SARS 3Clike protease [20, 21] .

Summary: In addition, the frequency of virus co-infection was slightly but not significantly higher in samples positive for H1N1v as compared with samples positive for other respiratory pathogens and viral mixed infection both with H1N1v and other viruses was not associated with a different clinical presentation. Far from being conclusive, the data suggest that these viruses may replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract of children with and without acute respiratory infections by other respiratory viruses, and that although TTV does not have a clear pathogenic role in acute respiratory diseases, it may influence the clinical presentation of the disease.

Title: viruses Pulmonary Involvement during the Ebola Virus Disease 
Summary: However, the massive presence of the virus in the lungs may be due to the fact that RESTV infection in pigs has been mostly associated with other infections of the respiratory tract, which may contribute to the specific localization of the virus and the respiratory symptoms of the disease. Specifically, the relevant proportion of EVD patients without any epidemiologic link to the exposure to contaminated biological samples or fomites, or to any contact with EVD patients; the evidence of respiratory signs and symptoms commonly reported all over the clinical course; the abundance of viral antigens in the lungs in animal necropsies; the prolonged persistence of EBOV detection and replication within the respiratory tract days after undetectable EBOV viral load in plasma; and similar clinical patterns in several other viral respiratory tract infections are all different parameters with consistent evidence of a major role in the pathogenesis of EVD in respiratory tissues [10] .

Title: Fungal diseases as neglected pathogens: A wake-up call to public health officials 
Summary: Given the intrinsic difficulties and high costs of drug development and the evident market and public health failures in this field, it is more realistic and impactful to make rational use of the diagnostic and antifungal tests already available to minimize the number of deaths caused by fungal diseases. The high incidence of invasive mycoses in AIDS patients and the recent examples of C. auris and E. rostratum demonstrate that, without game-changing actions, the perspective on how fungal diseases will impact human health in the coming decades is extremely negative.

Title: Immunogenetic Mechanisms Driving Norovirus GII.4 Antigenic Variation 
Summary: Both EIA and blockade data clearly indicate that Epitope D is critical for the binding of NVB 97 and suggest that amino acids 393-395 are important components of a GII.4 evolving blockade epitope in addition to modulating VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding [13, 21] . The prediction of five putative epitopes allowed us to gain several important insights into GII.4 norovirus evolution: 1) Discrete sites of variation occur on the GII.4 norovirus capsid, either directly on the surface or lateral to the HBGA binding sites; 2) Secondary variable sites are within 8 Å of the primary variable sites, and these secondary sites could also contribute to epitope remodeling; 3) Many of the putative expanded epitopes overlap, suggesting that two or more highly variable epitopes may work in concert to escape from an antibody response; 4) Putative epitopes that are buried may exert an effect on the structure by altering the interior fold space, allowing unconventional replacements to be tolerated; 5) An underlying amino acid network likely preserves the functional core of the capsid proteins by regulating the variable residues above them; and 6) Escape and HBGA binding may be intimately linked via the underlying regulatory network of amino acids that preserve the functional integrity of the capsid core.

Title: Fomite-mediated transmission as a sufficient pathway: a comparative analysis across three viral pathogens 
Summary: During a touching event, the amount of pathogens acquired is a function of the expected quantity of pathogen on F, the rate of effective touching (ρ T τ FH ) and the size of the area touched by fingers (κ, proportional to λ), so that the overall transfer of pathogens from fomites to hands is on fomites and H on hands. The difference in transmission between porous and non-porous surfaces is likely to have a larger impact on pathogens that are already close to the threshold for fomite transmission, such as influenza, and is probably less crucial for other pathogens, like norovirus and rhinovirus, where R 0 for the fomite route is far greater than 1.

The SARS data and the transitional metal data, on the other hand, showed the proposed method can also be used to search for potential global grouping structure for genes, and for arrays embedded in the given gene expression profiles.

On the other hand, if the Council were established as a separate entity, any resultant competition that emerged between the Council and the WHO would likely represent a boon for the global community, as it would force both the Council and the WHO to step up their games in order to remain relevant in the space of infectious disease threats.

Title: Virology Journal Amphotropic murine leukemia virus is preferentially attached to cholesterol-rich microdomains after binding to mouse fibroblasts 
Summary: All vector particles used in the present study were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells and since A-MLV but not VSV or viral particles lacking viral envelope proteins showed favored binding to large rafts, we conclude that this is due to the presence of A-MLV envelope protein on the particles and therefore most likely due to the presence of Pit2 in these regions. Indeed, the amount of A-MLV particles associated with large rafts within 30 minutes of virus exposure suggests that rafts are involved in early events of A-MLV binding and that A-MLV virions bind to the cells outside of caveolae and subsequently associate with caveolae in the entry process.

Title: Reining in the CD8+ T cell: Respiratory virus infection and PD-1-mediated T-cell impairment 
Summary: The tendency of CD8 + T cells to have significantly reduced functionality in the context of respiratory virus infection has been termed "T cell impairment". Other inhibitory receptors, including Lag-3, Tim-3, 2B4, and CTLA-4 are up-regulated in response to respiratory virus infection and appear to contribute to some degree of T-cell impairment, but thus far PD-1 appears to be the dominant inhibitory receptor for ARI [14] .

Title: Association of residential dampness and mold with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis: a meta-analysis 
Summary: In each meta-analysis model, we included multiple ORs from single studies that reported more than one OR for different but correlated risk factors (e. g., visible mold; dampness), different health outcomes (e.g., respiratory infection, common cold), or both; e.g., ORs in one study for visible mold with bronchitis, dampness with bronchitis, visible mold with respiratory infections, and dampness with respiratory infections. The IOM review in 2004 [2] made no conclusions relative to the association of dampness or mold with respiratory infections or bronchitis, but stated "Healthy persons exposed to dampness or moldy indoor environments sometimes report that they are more prone to respiratory infections...." The most recent review, by WHO in 2009 [3] , concluded that there is sufficient evidence to document an association of dampness and dampness-related agents with respiratory infections, but only limited or suggestive evidence of an association for bronchitis.

Title: Data-based analysis, modelling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak 
Summary: S � N. Based on this assumption, by Eqs (2), (3) and (4), the basic reproduction number can be estimated by the parameters of the SIRD model as: Let us denote with , the reported new cases of infectious, recovered and dead at time t, with CΔI(t), CΔR(t), CΔD(t) the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases at time t. Thus: where, X = I, R, D. Starting with the estimation of R 0 , we note that as the province of Hubei has a population of 59m, one can reasonably assume that for any practical means, at least at the beginning of the outbreak, S � N. By making this assumption, one can then provide an approximation of the expected value of R 0 using Eqs (5), (2), (3) and (4). Thus, a coarse estimation of the case fatality and recovery ratios for the period under study can be calculated using the reported cumulative infected, recovered and dead cases, by solving a linear regression problem, which for the case fatality ratio reads: Accordingly, in an analogy to the above, the case recovery ratio reads: As the reported data are just a subset of the actual number of infected and recovered cases including the asymptomatic and/or mild ones, we have repeated the above calculations considering twenty times the reported number of infected and forty times the reported number of recovered in the toal population, while leaving the reported number of dead the same given that their cataloguing is close to the actual number of deaths due to COVID-19.

To investigate whether the discrepancies with the inhibitory values reported above were due to the type of virus or to the different conditions and methods adopted, we tested the effects of chloroquine on replication of recent human H3N2 and H1N1 viral isolates under conditions similar to those adopted for the H5N9 avian influenza virus.

Title: Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors as vaccines for outbreak pathogens 
Summary: 13 MVA vectors have been successfully used to boost responses in adults induced by vaccination with BCG in infancy, demonstrating the potential of the MVA vector to boost any pre-existing T cell memory response 15 The development of multivalent MVA vectors, such as MVA BN-Filo which encodes four proteins from three ebolavirus species and Marburg virus, is also a potentially important tool for reducing the number of vaccine products that might need to be manufactured, by encoding protective antigens from several strains of the same pathogen or from multiple pathogens into the same vaccine construct (reviewed in 16 ) The large genome of MVA allows insertion of a larger amount of foreign DNA compared with other viral vectors including adenoviruses. In the case of an adenoviral vectored vaccine, on the other hand, variation in stability is expected to be minimal, since the vaccine antigen is not present in the viral capsid, and the composition of the virus particles would be very similar across different vaccines.

Title: Emerging Microbes & Infections (2017) 6, e3 
Summary: 20 On the basis of the Figure 1B) , the distances of lineages 1 and 2 compared with genotypes A, B and E were 40.7% (0.007 substitutions/site), whereas distances were o0.5% when compared with genotypes C and D. This finding indicates that lineages 1 and 2 were more similar to genotypes C and D compared with genotypes A, B and E. Although the low mean genetic distance of 0.29 ± 0.03% between genotypes C and D is probably attributed to the recombinant nature of genotype D (genotype D was generated from recombination between genotypes B and C), 7 it is the lowest reported full-length genetic distance that separates HCoV-OC43 genotypes. Phylogenetic incongruence found in the partial genes of these two unique lineages indicated possible recombination between genotypes, Our analyses on the full-length genome sequences of the unique HCoV-OC43 strains from novel lineages 1 and 2 20 confirm the identification of two novel genotypes, which are designated as genotypes F and G. These two novel genotypes were descendants of a previously reported recombinant genotype D, 7 which contained genotypes B and C as the putative parental genotypes and a genotype A-like genetic signal in the ORF1b gene.

Title: Is There Still Room for Novel Viral Pathogens in Pediatric Respiratory Tract Infections? 
Summary: DNA reads from one to five typical respiratory viruses were detected in 22 of the 25 sequenced double-negative individual and/or pooled samples from children with URTI ( Table 5) : The virus most frequently detected was RV, which was found in 19 of the pooled and/or individual samples; some of the samples had more than one type of virus, such that we found sequence reads from 4 RV subtype A, 4 subtype B, and 19 subtype C. One sample was positive for RSV, 3 for HCoV-OC43, 3 for human enterovirus A71, and 3 samples had HBoV. Altogether, these observations and the presence of DNA sequence reads from common respiratory viruses or bacteria in essentially 100% of the samples collected from children with LRTI and URTI, suggest there is limited potential for the discovery of so far undescribed, clinically relevant, viruses associated to pediatric respiratory disease at least in the type of populations studied and with the sampling and diagnostic methods employed.

Title: Introducing the Outbreak Threshold in Epidemiology 
Summary: We introduce such an outbreak threshold (T 0 ), and find that for large and homogeneous host populations, in which the pathogen has a reproductive ratio R 0 , on the order of 1/ Log(R 0 ) infected individuals are needed to prevent stochastic fade-out during the early stages of an epidemic. By fitting a function of order 1/kR 0 2 to the numerical data using leastsquares regression in Mathematica 8.0 [19] , we obtained the following adjusted form for the outbreak threshold T 0 in a heterogeneous population: As in the homogeneous case, T 0 only provides us with an order of magnitude and it can be multiplied by 2Log(c) to find the number of infected hosts required for there to be a probability of outbreak equal to 1-c. A sensitivity analysis shows that Equation 1 tends to be more strongly affected by changes in R 0 than in k (Material S.3 in Text S1).

Summary: Noteworthy, in most of these scenarios there are not complete diagnostic studies, but only the detection of the viral genome in a number of pigs affected by different clinical signs. In fact, PCV-3 has been already demonstrated retrospectively in Sweden in 1993 (93) and Spain (81) and China in 1996 (78) , indicating that this is not a new virus and it has been circulating during several decades in domestic pigs.

Title: Clinical features of children hospitalized with influenza A and B infections during the 2012-2013 influenza season in Italy 
Summary: Since that in the seasons 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 the circulation of FLUB was decreasing, the objective of this study was to characterize the clinical features, demographic characteristics, admitting department, and length of stay in the hospital for children, affected by FLUA and FLUB, admitted to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital and Research Institute during the 2012-2013 FLU season, with the aim to establish if the remerging of FLUB was associated to a clinical worsening, in comparison with those due to FLUA. The main findings from our study confirm that, although fever is a major component of influenza A and B presentation, respiratory symptoms were more severe and the length of the hospital stay was longer for FLUA patients than FLUB patients concluding that the increasing of FLUB in the season 2012-2013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation.

Title: SHORT REPORT Use of linked electronic health records to assess mortality and length of stay associated with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 at a UK teaching hospital 
Summary: Since this study concerned hospitalized patients only, it is not surprising that this value exceeds some other reported values, such as the estimated CFR in the UK from the first year of the pandemic of 0·04% [11] , which was calculated using estimated number of clinical cases from surveillance data as the denominator and number of deaths associated with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 as the numerator. In spite of these limitations, the association between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 H1N1 and reduced mortality among influenza A patients was strong, and provides further evidence that this strain of influenza was not as severe as was first feared.

Summary: Figure 6a and Figure 6b give the dynamics of the epidemics with different r. Both of the contour lines of the fraction of susceptible individuals for AI and CBI slope upwards, indicating that the coverage of the epidemics decrease with the increase of r. The effectiveness of AI and CBI was further compared in Figure 6c , which shows AI always outperforms CBI for r ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 and the predominance will strengthen with the increase of r. The effectiveness of RV is greatly denominated by r, q and t. The effectiveness of RV compared to AI and CBI with different r, q and t was analyzed in Figure 7 . With the increase of the basic reproductive number R 0 , the coverage of the epidemics will increase for all these three strategies, however the increase of the number of class R and class V individuals for RV is much less than for AI and CBI, indicating that RV notably outperforms AI and CBI.

Title: Emerging WuHan (COVID-19) coronavirus: glycan shield and structure prediction of spike glycoprotein and its interaction with human CD26 
Summary: Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. To better understand the structure of COVID-19, including the position and orientation of unique residues involved in target binding, we modelled the homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 S1 and S2 domains (spike glycoprotein) using SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) using the structure of SARS-CoV (PDB: 6ACD) [4] .

Title: GOST: A generic ordinal sequential trial design for a treatment trial in an emerging pandemic 
Summary: The primary trial endpoint in GOST is an ordinal categorisation of patient outcome as recorded a specified number of days following randomisation, and the sequential monitoring will lead to stopping as soon as it is clear that the experimental treatment has an advantage or that sufficient advantage is unlikely to be detected. The primary analysis will be based on the sequential design used, and will feature a onesided p-value for the null hypothesis of no treatment difference, and a median unbiased estimate and 95% confidence interval for R. In the final dataset, the numbers of new patients recruited to each treatment arm may not be as planned in the protocol, the allocation ratio might not be as intended and the information V accrued might not be as anticipated.

Title: Explaining the geographic spread of emerging epidemics: a framework for comparing viral phylogenies and environmental landscape data 
Summary: Artificial data sets were generated using four different approaches: (i) the duration of each movement event was randomly permuted among branches, (ii) the duration of each movement event was equal to the spatial distance along the path between its start and end locations, (iii) the duration of each movement event was equal to the environmental "weight" assigned to the path between the locations, and (iv) the duration is equal to a value randomly and uniformly chosen between the values defined in cases (ii) and (iii). The purpose of the analysis is to calculate a test statistic, D, for each environmental variable, E. The statistic D represents the degree to which the correlation between the duration and "weight" of each lineage is strengthened when spatial heterogeneity in E is taken into account (see in Methods for details).

Summary: The Mimivirus R341 protein exhibits a unique acidic extension of 65 residues at its C-terminal end (D5) and an  To confirm the functional prediction of Mg561 and R341, the proteins were purified and assayed in an in vitro polyadenylation assay on a synthetic 20-mers RNA without secondary structure in the presence of ATP and Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ as catalytic ions (Figure 2A and B). As suggested by the electrostatic potential properties of the molecular surface, the superimposition of one monomer of the Mg561 structure with VP55 in complex with ATP and RNA (PDB 3ERC) seems to confirm that both the ATP and the RNA molecule could bind Mg561 in a similar way to VP55 (Figure 5B ) and that the RNA molecule could enter through the central tunnel formed by the dimer (Figure 5C ).

Title: Viral OTU Deubiquitinases: A Structural and Functional Comparison 
Summary: Recently reported structures of these viral DUBs include the OTU domains of the nairoviruses Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) [22] [23] [24] and Dugbe virus (DUGV) [25] , the papain-like protease (PLP2) domain of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) [26] , and the protease (PRO) domain of the tymovirus turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) ( Figure 1A -1D) [27, 28] . Structural characterization of nairovirus (CCHFV and DUGV) OTU domains and EAV PLP2 in complex with Ub revealed that while these viral proteases adopt a fold that is consistent with eukaryotic OTU DUBs, they possess additional structural motifs in their S1 binding site that rotate the distal Ub relative to the binding orientation observed in eukaryotic OTU enzymes ( Figure 2D , 2E) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

Summary: For these particle sizes, for example, surgical masks would be effective, as they will act as a direct physical barrier to droplets of this size that are too large to be inhaled into the respiratory tract around the sides of the mask (which are not close-fitting); iii) 'intermediate particles' of diameters 10-20 μm, will share some properties of both small and large droplets, to some extent, but settle more quickly than particles < 10 μm and potentially carry a smaller infectious dose than large (> 20 μm) droplets. ' arguing from the more fundamental physical and dynamic behavior of small versus larger particle and droplet sizes in the absence of any biological interactions) to classifying which pathogens are likely to transmit via the airborne route have been published in various ways over the years [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , but may have to be considered in combination with epidemiological and environmental data to make a convincing argument about the potential for the airborne transmissibility of any particular agentand the number of possible potential exposure scenarios is virtually unlimited).

Title: Hantavirus Reservoirs: Current Status with an Emphasis on Data from Brazil 
Summary: These factors include the following: (i) geographical distribution of the host to map the maximum area where the hantavirus species is distributed and, consequently, where the hantavirus species that colonizes this host may occur; (ii) abundance of the reservoir species in the natural environment, which is considered a strong indicator of greater risk for human infection based on the fact that hantaviruses are zoonosis whose transmission depends on host population density; (iii) how the agent interacts with the host reservoir, which is a critical factor for understanding the spread and maintenance of hantaviruses in the environment. Four hantaviruses have been identified in shrew-moles: the Asama virus in Urotrichus talpoides, which occurs only on Japanese plains and islands; the Oxbow virus in Neurotrichus gibbsii, which is the smallest and most primitive mole in North America and can also be found in the western parts of Canada and the USA up to central California, where the Oxbow virus is sympatric and syntopic with other shrew and rodent hantavirus hosts such as the deer mouse; and the Cao Bang and Lianghe viruses, both of which have been identified in the Chinese shrew mole Anourosorex squamipes, which is an animal that inhabits forests located between 1500 and 3000 m in elevation and has a vast geographic range extending from central-western China to northern Myanmar, northern Thailand, Assam, Bhutan, North Vietnam, Taiwan and possibly Laos [24, 29] .

Title: Supporting Information S1. The EBCM approach 
Summary: (S2) represents the decrease of Φ S when a susceptible neighbor is infected, which is proportional to G ′ 1 (θ), i.e., the mean connectivity of the susceptible first neighbors or the excess degree of the susceptible individuals, because when a susceptible individual is infected, all its links except the one used to infected it, can transmit the disease. To obtain the evolution of I(t), we use the fact that, , the evolution of the fraction of infected individuals is given byİ where the first term represents the decrease of S which is proportional to β, the mean connectivity of susceptible individuals G ′ 0 (θ) and the probability that an outgoing edge from a root is connected with an infected node that has not transmitted the disease to the root at time t. The second term corresponds to the recovery of infected individuals at a rate γ.

Title: Promoting influenza prevention for elderly people in Hong Kong using health action process approach: study protocol 
Summary: Four specific objectives will be tested: (a) design and develop an intervention to promote influenza prevention behaviors consistent with guidelines of Department of Health in non-intending older adults; (b) imply the intervention in a sample of older adults in Hong Kong who reported never or rarely adopt influenza preventive measures during the past year using a randomized controlled trial; (c) evaluate the effectiveness and a 6-month sustainability of the intervention to change primary outcome variables (i.e., washing hands, avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth, facemask wearing, and vaccination); and (d) identify the psychological variables (i.e., intention, action and coping planning, maintenance and recovery self-efficacy) responsible for explaining the effect of the intervention. Several strategies will be introduced in the maintenance session and be compared with the concepts at the initiation session [22] : (a) maintenance/relapse prevention self-efficacy instead of action self-efficacy, that is, building the confidence in overcoming barriers to continue the influenza prevention behaviors (e.g., avoiding embarrassment of wearing a facemask in a public place); (b) coping planning should be emphasized rather than simply focused on action planning, this is because that the established new behavior patterns might be threatened by previous habits and some specific situations; (c) the feelings of enjoyment/satisfaction in complying to the influenza prevention behaviors will be emphasized rather than the expectations of the benefits of influenza prevention behaviors, this because perceived satisfaction has long been demonstrated as a significant predictor of behavior maintenance; and (d) participants will be encouraged to actively seeking social support from their networks, which will replace the support from the project facilitator when the project is withdrawn.

Title: An M2e-based multiple antigenic peptide vaccine protects mice from lethal challenge with divergent H5N1 influenza viruses 
Summary: In the present study, we designed and synthesized a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) derived from the M2e sequence of H5N1 virus VN/1194 strain, denoted as M2e-MAP, with an aim to develop a M2e-based vaccine for induction of M2e-specific immune responses and cross-protection of the vaccinated animals against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 virus strains. Compared with those from the adjuvant control (FCA/ FIA or alum), the virus titers in the lungs of M2e-MAP vaccinated mice were significantly lower after H5N1 virus challenge (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2 ), suggesting that M2e-MAP vaccine can induce protective immunity against viral replication in vaccinated mice.

Title: Inhibition of RNA Helicases of ssRNA + Virus Belonging to Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae Families 
Summary: General strategies to design specific and selective drugs for the treatment of viral infections targeting helicase could act via one or more of the following mechanisms: (1) inhibition of the NTPase activity by interferences with ATP binding and therefore by limiting the energy required for the unwinding and translocation, (2) inhibition of the NTPase activity by allosteric mechanism and therefore by stabilizing the conformation of the enzyme in low helicase activity state, (5) inhibition of unwinding by sterically blocking helicase translocation, (6) development of small molecule antagonists against essential protein-protein interactions involving helicases. This derivative is able to block the NTPbinding site (IC 50 = 22 μM) and to inhibit the ATPase activity (IC 50 = 17 μM) in a competitive way, but is not able to inhibit the helicase activity at concentration lower than 1 mM [14] The partial unwinding activity mediated by these competitive NTPase inhibitors is common to all members of the class, and the concentrations needed for the helicase inhibition usually exceed the IC 50 value by 3-5 times.

Summary: Despite the increase in the number of vaccine doses administered in 2015 as compared to 2014, the level of vaccine coverage (30% in sheep and goats, 35% in buffaloes and 60% in cattle) would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country, in particular in those governorates where the level of vaccination is below average. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the surroundings of the five quarantines available in Egypt was estimated to be quite low except in the case of Al Qata (where some of the camels imported from Ethiopia arrive).

Title: Experimental screening studies on rabies virus transmission and oral rabies vaccination of the Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) 
Summary: While two of these animals remained seronegative prior to infection, one Kudu (K46) had detectable levels of antibodies at the time point of capture but turned seronegative at days 28 and 56 p.v.. After challenge infection all three survivors developed high levels of rabies specific antibodies; the GMT of these individual animals increased to 1.27 IU/ml at day 183 p.i., resembling a 5.8 and 2.9 fold increase compared to day 0 and day 56 p.v., respectively (Tables 3, S3, Fig. While the relatively short incubation periods of 12-26 days observed after high dose infection are within the lower bounds of the expected range and are comparable to those of carnivorous reservoir species, Kudus and cattle 12, 19, [31] [32] [33] [34] , the extremely long incubation periods of 93-245 days after low dose infection are remarkable, particularly against the background of the same route of infection and the fact that the difference in viral dose was just two log 10 steps (Fig.

Title: Compare the differences of synonymous codon usage between the two species within cardiovirus 
Summary: All these results imply that the codon bias of Cardiovirus especially the ThV can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition, in other words, by mutation pressure rather than natural selection and the (C+G) content has a more significant effect for ThV than EMCV To investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among Cardiovirus, COA was used for all 39 Cardiovirus complete coding regions selected for this study. The mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias that is supported by the highly significant correlation between (C+G) 12 % and (C+G) 3 % (r = -0.736 for EMCV; r = 0.986 for ThV, P < 0.01), but the (C+G) content plays a more important role in codon usage bias for ThV than for EMCV.

Because the causative type II viruses with the distinct genetic marker in the S gene were confirmed to be a recombinant of feline and canine coronaviruses and some of the kittens that died earlier were found to have been living closely with dogs between being rescued and entering the shelter, any of these kittens could have been the source of this type II virus.

Summary: The ability of p7 to elicit CF release and proton transport has been tested in the controled conditions where the p7 conformation was known, which allowed to infer that the 'a-helical hairpin' form is responsible for proton transport, but not of CF release. We note that in a recently published structural model of p7 [20] , TM1 and TM2 would correspond to three helical segments H1-H3, i.e., To test if form A is responsible for CF release, we incorporated p7 into CF-containing PAESC liposomes by the dyalisis method, freeze-thawing and extrusion, which should result in p7 incorporation in membranes in an a-helical form A (see Fig.

Summary: The efficiency of FRET between pyrene and NBD labeled to the N-and C-termini of TMD and FP peptides in different combinations is compared to determine the orientation of the TMD:FP complex. Perhaps the role of TMD in the membrane fusion is twofold: first, mechanically it anchors the fusion protein onto the viral membrane and secures the oligomerization of the fusion protein through its tight self-association, and importantly, it does not destabilize the membrane in the absence of FP; second, it has a weak interaction with FP, thereby reinforcing the destabilizing effect of FP on the inner leaflet of the target membrane by deepening FP membrane insertion (Figure 7) .

Title: The Impact of Farmers' Strategic Behavior on the Spread of Animal Infectious Diseases 
Summary: The correlations explored are between the accumulated number of infected nodes at a specific time period (the period was chosen such that the average fraction of nodes infected was 50%) and three different variables that characterize the early periods of infection: the degree (number of edges) and closeness (defined as the inverse of farness, which is the sum of the distances from the selected node to the rest of the nodes in the network) of the initially infected node and the time period at which the first infection of a hub (dealer or market) takes place. But if there is a correlation between the risk of infection and the geographic proximity to infected nodes (as is the case of vector-borne diseases), by increasing the RZ, the nodes located at the frontier are less likely to be infected so they have a smaller effect on disease spreading even if they sell prematurely.

Title: Article 211 Citation: Zhao C and Zhao W (2020) NLRP3 Inflammasome-A Key Player in Antiviral Responses 
Summary: During infection, viruses cause a series of changes in cellular status of their host cells, including lysosomal maturation, aberrant ion concentrations, mitochondria damage, and the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, all of which are recognized as danger signals by the host and lead to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this review, we focused on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during viral infection, as well as the immune evasion strategies of viruses.

Title: An infectious way to teach students about outbreaks A R T I C L E I N F O 
Summary: Epidemics 23 (2018) • Students need to make sure to put their name on the form and the names of those they have infected Over the five years, the class size increased, however, this did not appear to affect the ability for an outbreak to be sustained, with the smallest and largest class sizes (2012 and 2016 respectively) yielding the highest cumulative attack rate. Sampling the generation time and recovery time directly from the observed distributions, rather than sampling from a Poisson distribution with a mean based on the observed data, markedly improves the closeness of the simulated outbreak to the observed outbreak.

Title: Polyphyletic origin of MERS coronaviruses and isolation of a novel clade A strain from dromedary camels in the United Arab Emirates 
Summary: Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes of the ten sequenced MERS-CoV isolates showed that one isolate belongs to clade A, and nine belong to clade B (Table 2; Figure 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome, ORF1a, ORF1b and the S gene sequences all showed that the clade A strain, D998/15, isolated from a 1-month-old dromedary calf from a special dairy farm in Dubai, is a unique member of clade A, being most closely related to another dromedary isolate, NRCE-HKU205, which was previously detected in Egypt ( Figure 3 ).

A 'one-size-fits-all' privacy-preserving solution is unlikely to be successful or to be able to capture and properly address the complex requirements, which might also vary from country to country, of the very many (i) user roles, with different access privileges and 'needs to know' in relation to various input and output data types; (ii) intra and extra-mural data sharing arrangements, especially when data need to be moved across heterogeneous organisations; (iii) governing legislations and policies; (iv) possible forms of data inputs that can be released for research and the associated conditions; (v) health study types and goals, data analysis methods and the data requirements in each case; (vi) possible study outputs/ results reporting and publication forms (closed or public); (vii) situation-specific security risks; and (viii) riskscosts-benefits assessment, among other aspects and requirements that are involved in this area of research and need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Title: Classical Swine Fever Virus vs. Classical Swine Fever Virus: The Superinfection Exclusion Phenomenon in Experimentally Infected Wild Boar 
Summary: Notwithstanding the high infection rate of the Cat01 strain in persistently infected animals from group B (primary virus infection), good health status was maintained after inoculation with the Margarita CSFV virulent strain (secondary infection) in the absence of viral detection in sera throughout the study, except in one animal at 13 dpi with a low Margarita strain RNA load (animal 4). In contrast, the CSFV Margarita strain generated the acute form of the disease in animals from group A, with high Margarita RNA loads in all of the samples analysed.

Title: Pandemic clinical case definitions are non- specific: multiple respiratory viruses circulating in the early phases of the 2009 influenza pandemic in New South Wales, Australia 
Summary: The emergence of a novel pathogen of pandemic potential, as occurred in 2009 with the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, requires the development of clinical case definitions to assist in managing the clinical, laboratory and public health responses to the new disease. As A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was only detected in 3.8% of samples, we performed NAT for other respiratory viruses on randomly selected samples collected from subjects that had met the clinical case definition during the CONTAIN phase.

Title: Epidemiology and Infection Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America 
Summary: We then weighted the risk estimated for each city with the number of reported infected people in each city by 31 January 2020 [14] and estimated the mean average risk of transmission termed as 'Risk index' which follows the equation below: where x is the destination country, Risk index (x) is the risk of infection importation in country x, P(x) n is the number of passengers to country x from city n, P n is the total number of passengers who left city n, I n is the number of infected people in city n and C n is the population size of city n. The risk index denotes the risk of at least one case being imported into a country or territory where 1 means an absolute certainty and 0 means no risk at all. Outside China, the countries with the highest risk of 2019-nCoV transmission from our model were Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which have reported at least one case.

Title: Fatal canine distemper virus infection of giant pandas in China 
Summary: The surviving panda tested positive for CDV by RT-PCR, but did not develop overt clinical signs of CDV infection and was previously vaccinated against CDV, strongly supporting the utility of CDV vaccination in giant pandas. We therefore speculate that the high-level of virulence associated with giant panda/SX/2014 infection of giant pandas may be related to the presence of a histidine residue at position 549 of the H protein.

In summary, we described the occurrence of IPD in a major U.S. urban center and found that incidence was associated with marked wintertime seasonality that may be partly explained by diminished exposure to UV-B radiation in winter months.

Title: Failure of Fluid Absorption in the Endolymphatic Sac Initiates Cochlear Enlargement that Leads to Deafness in Mice Lacking Pendrin Expression 
Summary: Thus, the goal of the present study was to determine the onset of cochlear enlargement and to investigate whether the enlargement of the cochlea in Slc26a4 2/2 mice is due to a local cochlear dysfunction or whether the cochlear enlargement is caused by dysfunction of the adjacent vestibular labyrinth or endolymphatic sac. The most salient findings of this study are 1) that lumen formation begins between E13.5 and E14.5 at the base of the cochlea, 2) that the cochlea lumen is transiently, prior to E17.5, controlled by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth and absorption in the endolymphatic sac and 3) that loss of pendrin expression leads to an enlargement of the cochlear lumen that is similar to the enlargement caused by resection of the endolymphatic sac.

Title: In the name of the greater good? 
Summary: 2 In writings based on public health, utilitarianism is widely recognized as a fragment in the ethical 'scheme' of public health, 3 but it is not afforded a stronger role for two primary reasons: first, considering its extreme position, utilitarianism is morally problematic, 4 as it could literally permit anything in the name of the 'greatest good to the greatest number,' and second it is virtually impossible to live a moral life under the most extreme forms of utilitarianism, because the obligations are too difficult to discern (the 'what' of promoting the good) and impossible to execute (the 'how'). 15 However, the added value of a HCW is the fact that he or she will be facing the greater risk by virtue of faithful and responsible execution of his or her duty, and if this is trueFand we have seen from the example of SARS that it is not always the case that HCWs exercise due diligence or face unmanageable risks of infection simply by being 'on-site'Fthen we should do more to protect them.

Title:  
Summary: The standard deviation width of an epidemic curve consisting of N incidence measure- In this analysis we select the exponential rise portion of the epidemic curve by identifying incidence data points at the beginning of the epidemic that are sufficiently many standard deviations away from the time of peak incidence (denoted by t peak ) that a fit of an exponential curve to simulated data in that region provides unbiased estimates of the true exponential rise. That is, to estimate the time variation of the incidence, y pred (t), we use a compartmental model that simulates the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals in the population using the coupled deterministic ordinary non-linear differential equations ( [1] ): where 1/κ and 1/γ are the average latent and infectious periods, respectively, β = R 0 γ is the transmission rate, and population size is given by N = S + E + I + R.

Title: Chikungunya as a paradigm for emerging viral diseases: Evaluating disease impact and hurdles to vaccine development 
Summary: Therefore, for the reasons reported above, the development of a safe and effective vaccine against CHIKF would have a significant impact on the global burden of this disease with important health, economic, and ethical implications: (i) because of the high infection rates during epidemic waves, the disease burden may be relatively high. An effective vaccine would reduce the number of cases and hospitalizations worldwide, producing economic benefits through the reduction of absenteeism, lower costs for care and hospitalizations, and reduced loss of income associated with tourism; (ii) countries outside the tropics might also benefit from the development of a CHIKF vaccine, because the virus may be introduced from endemic and/or epidemic areas or enzootic circulation and eventually spread to regions where competent urban vectors are present; (iii) protection of travelers and military personnel may be another positive outcome of vaccine development; (iv) there are clear ethical implications in the development of a vaccine against an emerging neglected disease that primarily affects resource-limited parts of the globe.

Summary: 8 Since there were no significant differences in viral concentrations between EMC wt and EMC 205-S2′ S-pseudovirions (Supplementary Figure 2A) , we attribute the drop in infectivity to the mutation of the S2′ site in the EMC 205-S2′ S protein. 12 The cell-cell fusion assays we performed have shown that introducing the EMC/2012 S2′ site in the HKU205 S background was accompanied by significant enhancement of fusogenicity, but to levels that did not reach the ones observed for wild-type EMC/2012 S. Likewise, the pseudotyped particle infectivity assays have shown that wild-type HKU205 S-pseudovirions have very little infectivity, while substituting its S2′ site with the furin site found in EMC/2012 significantly increased infectivity in Huh-7 cells, but did not restore it to the levels observed for wild-type EMC/2012 S-pseudovirions.

Title: Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) Exhibits Potent, Rapid Activity Against Influenza Viruses in vitro and in vivo 
Summary: Second, TEM analyses showed that while the viral envelope of untreated influenza viruses was intact, exposure to CPC led to disruption of the envelope and gross distortion of viral ultrastructure (eg cavitation, Figure 3 ) To further confirm that CPC disrupts the influenza virus envelope, we used ELISA to monitor the release of nucleoprotein from viruses in response to increasing concentrations of CPC. To evaluate the potential of CPC to induce drug resistance, influenza virus was exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC, and the EC 50 following 10 passages of drug exposure was determined ( Figure 5 ).

Because a fundamental requirement for the designation of a new pathogen is precise identification of the reservoir taxon [1] , we advocate formal incorporation of museum biorepositories and integrated databases as critical infrastructure for pathogen discovery and pathobiology research.

Summary: In addition, multiple participants also suggested that how different populations might be placed at a disadvantage by a given criterion should be considered, as a participant from the expert San Antonio group explained: [Participant To facilitate fairness, forum members suggested several mechanisms that could be put in place before an emergency including a universal medical records system (as this would inform decisions based on who would be most likely to survive a current illness and live the longest) and the redistribution of ventilators so there is equal geographic coverage (both within cities and between counties in the state) based on current population sizes. It was also noted that successfully treating people in a pandemic situation would possibly be a morale booster, as a participant in San Antonio noted: In terms of concerns, respondents noted that it is impossible for clinicians to be certain of who will survive or live the longest, and that in regards to patients' health histories (a factor respondents felt would be important in determining who is most likely to live the longest) this criteria might cause patients or their family members to lie in order to "cheat the system".

As in the case of structural studies on the L-type lectins [27] [28] [29] , this crystal structure along with the NMR structure of the MRH domain of the glucosidase II β subunit, has given insights into structural mechanisms of the manner in which structurally homologous MRH domains exhibit disparate sugar-binding specificities in terms of the presence of the outermost mannose residues at the D3 branch.

Title: The tree shrew provides a useful alternative model for the study of influenza H1N1 virus 
Summary: Therefore, we hypothesized that clinically apparent infections can arise from infection of influenza viruses in tree shrew, and tested our hypothesis to evaluate the tree shrew to be potential in the study of influenza. In tree shrews, the SA α2,6 Gal receptor that is more frequently associated with human influenza viruses was restricted primarily to the trachea and some bronchus, whereas the SAα2,3 Gal receptor preferentially bound by avian viruses was more abundantly present in the pulmonary alveoli and respiratory epithelium, which was similar to humans and ferrets [36, 37] .

Title: Genome-wide expression profiling shows transcriptional reprogramming in Fusarium graminearum by Fusarium graminearum virus 1-DK21 infection 
Summary: Note that 118 genes (28.2%) were downregulated while 81 genes (22.9%) were up-regulated at 36 h, whereas there were more up-regulated genes (95) than down-regulated genes (79) at 120 h. Based on the number of differentially expressed genes, it is likely that genes involved in various metabolic pathways were severely repressed at 36 h and then were gradually induced at 120 h. Along with a gene set for metabolism, genes associated with energy were highly down-regulated (26 genes) at 36 h (Table 2 ). Conversely, the number of upregulated genes that govern cellular transport was similar to that of the down-regulated genes at 120 h. Next, we analyzed the enriched gene ontology (GO) terms of the differentially expressed genes.

Title: Species-specific evolution of immune receptor tyrosine based activation motif-containing CEACAM1-related immune receptors in the dog 
Summary: To determine the degree of relatedness between the primordial canine CEACAM genes with the orthologous genes in mice and man, the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of the leader, the IgV-type N domain, the IgC-type A and B domains, the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain exons were compared ( Table 1 ). First, the direction of the gene conversion was most likely from the inhibitory receptor to the activating receptor, second, the Ka/Ks ratio of the N domain exons of these family members is indicative for a purifying selection, whereby the specificity of the putative CEACAM1 ligand is probably conserved for CEACAM28, third, the amino acid changes observed for the CEACAM28 N domain most likely have no effect on the structure of that part of the N domain shown to be the pathogen binding site in human and mouse CEACAM1 and fourth, is expressed by immune cells (T, probably B and/or NK cells and granulocytes), a prerequisite for a defense function against a putative pathogen.

Title: Estimating the incidence reporting rates of new influenza pandemics at an early stage using travel data from the source country 
Summary: The method is able to estimate the incidence reporting rate by using the local routine surveillance data with estimates refined from statistics of travellers from the source country for an influenza pandemic. The figure demonstrated that an increasing reporting rate was associated with exponential decreases in R 0 ; thus, only fitting the surveillance data to the epidemic model would provide unreliable findings for the estimation of the r. Using these estimates, there was a 0·7% (95% CI 0·4-1·1) cumulative incidence in the Mexican population at the end of April 2009, which was the time that the pandemic phase 5 alert level was announced by the WHO.

Title: Epidemiology and Transmission of Respiratory Infections in Thai Army Recruits: A Prospective Cohort Study 
Summary: We computed the rates of URI and ILI as the number of cases of each outcome divided by the total person-time at risk, using robust standard errors in the calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to allow for clustering of illness episodes by camp and cohort. We determined the percentage of recruits with a positive identification of a bacterial pathogen at recruitment, the overall change in colonization prevalence between baseline and end of follow-up for each bacterial species, and the risk of acquisition of bacterial pathogens over the follow-up period among those initially negative.

Summary: The cross board group considered the outline, supported the main trial and virological study, but asked us to consider: 1) lengthening the recruitment rate and support follow-up; we have added 6 months to the recruitment time; in our previous study we recruited practices and completed follow-up in 2 years for 4000+ patients with a lower level of resourcing per practice recruited and patient recruited ; adding a further 6 months allows for the increased difficulties in the current climate, and we have also increased clerical support modestly to aid with follow-up in the final year (this is now altogether more than 50% more resource available for notes review per patient recruited and over a 50% longer time period than we used in our previous trial 22 ); we can add a further 6 months if the Board desires (but that will require another 6 months staff time pro rata) 2) providing more details for the development phase (particularly survey methodology and objectives): we have provided more details of the development phase which will be led by Prof Yardley 3) providing more details of the latest evidence base for the nature and impact of the behavioural change envisaged : we have completed our Cochrane review of the use of patient information in self limiting illness including influenza; we have augmented the discussion of the latest reviews of the evidence base for the nature and impact of the likely behavioural change; the most well documented behaviour is hand-washing which from the limited range of existing studies probably has a slightly greater effect in preventing transmission than our proposed effect size; thus we will concentrate on hand-washing as the primary behaviour of interest; there is less evidence for the other behaviours but all are included as part of both national and international guidance and are plausibly likely to have additional impact to hand-washing 4) setting out clear intermediate milestones/deliverables so that the feasibility and relevance of the RCT could be assessed: we have provided three key deliverables related to the development of the intervention and propose that if the last Key deliverable (i.e. the change in attitudes and intentions based on the pilot study -is not met, then the main RCT does not continue 5) limiting the patients to those with web access; we have modified the protocol to accommodate this; although the number of families with web access is rapidly increasing year on year (last year 60%) there may well still be issues of equity of access to the web based on financial considerations; we will deal with this in both secondary analysis (by estimating whether index of deprivation is related to uptake of the offer of invitation to participate and whether it modifies the effect sizes); we can also explore encourage participation by encouraging web access from local libraries for those families that do not have access to the web at home; finally we will develop a booklet form of the intervention, and although we will not evaluate it separately as part of this trial, it could potentially be made available for families with no access to the web.

Title: Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses Adapt for Increased Fitness over Long- Term Passage without Reversion of Exoribonuclease-Inactivating Mutations 
Summary: The evolved mutations in MHV-ExoN(-) nsp14 and nsp12, which encodes the RdRp, accounted for only part of the increased nucleoside analogue resistance of MHV-ExoN(-) P250, implicating multiple replicase proteins in adaptation for viral fitness. Together, these data demonstrate that MHV-ExoN(-) evolved increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogues that correlated with the length of passage and the acquisition of mutations in nsp12 and nsp14.

Title: Mapping infectious disease hospital surge threats to lessons learnt in Singapore: a systems analysis and development of a framework to inform how to DECIDE on planning and response strategies 
Summary: Our objectives are to: (1)Identify the basic conceptual elements of hospital ID surges, combining constructs from the literature [13] [14] [15] 17] with those emergent in our data, and situating analysis by describing the backdrop of ID surge events featuring in our context; (2)Describe a typology of ID hospital surge threat scenarios primarily in relation to virulent air/droplet borne diseases -contrasting with vector borne scenarios -and link this to levels of alert for hospital planning and response; (3)Collate lessons learnt from past air/droplet borne ID outbreaks and catalogue these into incident management strategies related to: staffing, space, supplies (or 'stuff ' sic) [15] and systems [14, 15] . It was however notable to us that the biggest drain on the system appeared to be the lack of confirmed decision on this policy -which resulted in stockpiling and planning for a 'what if we have to cope with this alone' scenarios, which can be seen as siloed, duplicative and ultimately wasteful strategies.

Title: Bringing together emerging and endemic zoonoses surveillance: shared challenges and a common solution 
Summary: The importance of interactions between human, wildlife and domestic animal populations, the potential for the rapid global spread of emerging pathogens and appreciation of the need to carry out surveillance for as yet unknown pathogens demonstrate the need for new approaches to surveillance that are both more comprehensive and more flexible than those that have existed previously [2] . While these are clearly essential, there is also a need to recognize constraints that operate at the grassroots level; animal and human health workers who work at the community level in developed and developing countries are the primary source of surveillance data, and it is important to understand the factors that affect their ability and willingness to report disease outbreaks.

Title: First report of Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in peafowls in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China 
Summary: There are limited studies on the infection of T. gondii in peafowls in the world, and only one survey of T. gondii in peafowls was conducted in Shanghai Zoological Garden in China in 2000 that utilized MAT, where only 1 of the 5 examined peafowls was found positive with a titer of 1:640, the survey was conducted 10 years ago with low sampling size and the management of birds is constantly changing, hygiene in general has improved in recent years, so no firm conclusion should be drawn from that early observation. The number of blue peafowls sampled was large enough for the findings to be conclusive, but the sample size of green peafowls was quite small, thus this study has some potential limitations in that the results of the present study may not reflect the actual T. gondii seroprevalence in green peafowls, in both species in other seasons, and in other regions of Yunnan Province.

Title: Ebola virus disease outbreak in Korea: use of a mathematical model and stochastic simulation to estimate risk 
Summary: If the assumption is made that no diagnosis is confirmed nor the first EVD patient is isolated for 3 days after he or she has been hospitalized (SII: 3 days), it was found that 1 new secondary case in the C and 2 cases from HCWs would additionally occur compared to the numbers from the prompt diagnosis and isolation against the first imported case (SI); The epidemic duration is supposed to increase by 14 days, and the probability of having more than 10 cases is 10.5%, which is 6.4% points higher than that of the prompt diagnosis and isolation scenario against the first domestic case. In the simulation, most of the increase in total patients in SII and SIII compared with that in SI is from the HCW group, as characteristics of EVD transmission that the risk of infection is shown to be higher for HCWs.

Nevertheless, the goal of a safe and affordable blood supply that can meet the growing global demands may be reached by the coordinated optimization of each step in the transfusion chain, including the careful consideration of donor eligibility criteria, adherence to rigorous rules during donation, processing and storage, the optimal implementation of available screening tests, the use of suitable pathogen inactivation methods and finally the vigilance of prudent physicians, who evaluate the necessity of each transfusion.

Title: PER1 prevents excessive innate immune response during endotoxin-induced liver injury through regulation of macrophage recruitment in mice 
Summary: Either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS challenge, a marked increase was observed in the number of KCs in the livers of Per1 − / − mice compared with the livers of WT mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against the KC marker genes F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3a and b) , as well as by the increased hepatic expression of F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3c and d) . However, in vitro experiments revealed that Per1 has no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice macrophages, suggesting the higher hepatic levels of cytokines in Per1 − / − mice may be due to the increased number of cells responding to LPS in the liver.

Title: High Pulmonary Levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in Children with Chronic Suppurative Lung Disease Are Associated with Low Systemic IFN-γ Production in Response to Non- Typeable Haemophilus influenzae 
Summary: Accumulating evidence from studies in adults [5, 6] and children [7, 8] suggest that a low capacity for IFN-γ production in response to NTHi may contribute to the cycle of infection and inflammation associated with the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. In contrast, BAL IL-8, IP-10, neutrophil % and infection status, as well as blood platelets were no longer independent predictors of the IFN-γ response to NTHi by blood mononuclear cells This study is the first to investigate the association between the systemic cell-mediated immune response and airway inflammation in children with CSLD.

Title: Comparative and kinetic analysis of viral shedding and immunological responses in MERS patients representing a broad spectrum of disease severity OPEN 
Summary: Although the association of gender on mortality was not statistically significant (p = 0.071) potentially due to limited patient numbers, it is worth nothing that two-thirds of patients in the severe disease groups (group III and IV) were men and all the patients in the mild disease groups (group I and II) were women. Although most of the chemokines involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes were highly elevated in group II and III patients who suffered from pneumonia, the overall chemokine responses, except MCP-1 and IP-10, were relatively reduced in the fatal cases.

Summary: However, viral RNA was detected in these samples after 2 days at RT and 20 days at 4 • C; the RNA levels were similar to those of input virus indicating no significant changes in viral genome levels in feces ( Figure 4B and Table 1 ). The rate of loss in infectivity was uniform on Styrofoam, aluminum, plastic, and Tyvek ® coverall, whereas viral infectivity on metal, nitrile gloves, and rubber dropped rapidly after 5 days at 4 • C. Furthermore, at 0 days post application (i.e., post 2 h of air drying), there was decreased virus recovery from cardboard and cloth, indicating that the composition of the fomite and the porosity of the PEDV-contaminated materials may influence virus survival.

Title: Triple Combination of Amantadine, Ribavirin, and Oseltamivir Is Highly Active and Synergistic against Drug Resistant Influenza Virus Strains In Vitro 
Summary: The synergy of the TCAD regimen in the presence of amantadine was greater than the synergy of the ribavirin/oseltamivir carboxylate double combination without amantadine, and the increase in the synergy of the TCAD regimen was observed at 0.32 mg/mL amantadine for NC V27A and 1 mg/mL amantadine for WI S31N, when significance was evaluated at the level of ,0.05. Thus, all three drugs contributed to the synergy and activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine-and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, and the activities of amantadine and oseltamivir were restored in the context of the TCAD regimen against influenza strains that were resistant to these drugs, thereby maximizing the clinical utility of these drugs.

Title: Oligomerization domains in the glycan-binding receptors DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR: Sequence variation and stability differences 
Summary: Some of the distinct structural features conserved in the DC-SIGNR genes are the presence of the stabilizing leucine residue at position 6 of all but the first and last repeat units and the presence of the unusual phenylalanine residue at position 6 in the repeat unit adjacent to the CRD, although there is variation in the number of repeat units. The presence of potentially less stable repeat units in the half of the DC-SIGN neck domain further from the membrane, and the presence of repeat units containing the potentially disruptive methionine residues at position 6 in a repeat unit in the middle of the neck domain, raises the possibility that the Cterminal portion of the neck domain might dissociate some of the time, so that the extracellular domain would be able to accommodate different spacings of sugar residues, as observed in recent studies with mannose-coated particles.

Summary: Organization of the chIFITM locus in PacBio contig 2 and Gallus gallus v4 and v5 reference sequences To study in more detail the gene order of the v4 and v5 assembled locus relative to our assembly we used Artemis. The deep and accurate sequence of the chIFITM locus allows us to be confident that the chIFITM1 and 2 genes as named and annotated in the v5 genome are indeed inverted in comparison to the human locus with chIFITM1, 2, 3 and 5 genes having their transcriptional units in the same direction (Table 3 ) [23] .

Summary: For example, diversity within genotypes in the nonoverlapping region within the X gene is decreased relative to the other nonoverlapping regions ( Figure 3B ), most likely a result of overlap with the basal core promoter region, a regulatory element of the genome that controls expression of precore mRNA and pregenomic RNA. 111 Analysis of HBV sequences from a family transmission network found the precore and middle region of the S gene to be hotspots for sequence diversity compared with the relative Overlapping ORFs and regulatory regions in viral genome (Figures 2A and 3B ) impose constraint on viral plasticity 102 because nonsynonymous mutations have to be accommodated within 2 different proteins to be viable; this makes most mutations disadvantageous, 113 an example of constrained evolution.

Title: Integrated Microfluidic Nucleic Acid Isolation, Isothermal Amplification, and Amplicon Quantification 
Summary: Molecular diagnostics is comprised of the sequential steps of lysis (when the target nucleic acids are sequestered in cells or viruses); nucleic acid isolation (extraction, concentration, and purification of DNA and RNA from the lysate); reverse transcription for RNA targets, enzymatic amplification of target DNA or RNA with sequence-specific primers; and real-time or endpoint detection of amplification products. POC devices and operation are significantly simplified by (1) a multifunctional reaction chamber that includes an embedded membrane for the capture of DNA and RNA, storage of reagents, and the in situ amplification of NA on the membrane which circumvents the need for a separate elution step and decouples sample size from amplification reaction volume; and (2) isothermal (constant temperature) amplification such as LAMP (Loop mediated amplification) with real-time detection, using for example, a smartphone CCD camera as detector.

Title: Alveolar Macrophages Infected with Ames or Sterne Strain of Bacillus anthracis Elicit Differential Molecular Expression Patterns 
Summary: The observed differences in cytokine responses for AMs infected with Ames or Sterne spores led us to investigate the global gene expression pattern of AMs in response to B. anthracis infection. These studies also suggest that the observed differences in host response are probably not due to the delay in the uptake of the Ames spores as different gene sets are modulated following Ames or Sterne infection.

Summary: MERS-CoV infection in these animals merely causes mild upper respiratory tract infection [17, 18] , but seroepidemiological studies showed that this virus has been circulating in dromedary camels for decades, suggesting the efficient transmission of MERS-CoV in this species [19] [20] [21] [22] . This different MERS-CoV tropism in dromedary camels and humans is in line with the localization of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of these two species.

Title: Effects of Storage Time on Total Protein and Globulin Concentrations in Bovine Fresh Frozen Plasma Obtained for Transfusion 
Summary: The results indicate that plasma concentrations (g/dL) of TP and ALB change after 1 month of storage at −20 ∘ C, whereas concentrations of beta-2 protein fractions were stable for 6 months at −20 ∘ C. The significant effects of storage time on mean concentration of TP and on the concentration of protein fractions with the percentage of variation observed in fresh and frozen/thawed sera for each protein fraction are reported in Table 2 . So bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer of immunity) in calves when stored for 12 months at −20 ∘ C. This study suggests that total gamma globulin concentration in bovine frozen plasma is stable for 12 months at −20 ∘ C. Total protein, ALB, and beta-2 fraction have significantly different concentrations when expressed as g/dL compared to prestorage.

While the WT + C del mixture is similarly capable of binding to the RNA molecule as Re-CsrA, the inhibition of CsrA/RNA binding by CesT with WT + C del (in which case CesT would polymerize with CsrA) is apparently more effective than that with Re-CsrA (in which case CesT would form uniform complexes with Re-CsrA) (Supplementary Fig.

Summary: Moreover, it was also shown that while the mRNAs of RSV were vulnerable to siRNA, the viral genome in contrast was resistant, likely due to the fact that the negative strand RNA viral genome is generally wrapped with the viral nucleocapsid protein (N or NP) and hence inaccessible to the guide strand RNA [9] . The IN route is particularly promising for the prevention and therapy of influenza and other respiratory viral infections [13, 31, 32] since it delivers the siRNA directly to the lung, the primary site of infection, thus ensuring the specificity of delivery and minimizing systemic siRNA loss and toxicity (see below).

Title: Facile synthesis of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzo-and 7-azabenzotriazoles from peptide coupling agents, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications 
Summary: Although at the present time we do not know the exact nature of the interaction of these bases with BOP, it is clear that a reaction occurs, and this may be responsible for the lower yields in the reactions of alcohols with BOP. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions of alcohols with these peptide-coupling reagents, in the presence of a base, appear to proceed by formation of alcohol phosphonium derivatives (with BOP), or alcohol tosylates (with Bt-OTs), and not through direct displacement of the leaving group by attack at the N1 or by a S N 2'-type of process by reaction at the N3 of the triazolyl moiety.

Title: A Study of the Mechanism of the Chaperone-like Function of an scFv of Human Creatine Kinase by Computer Simulation 
Summary: Firstly, bioinformatics software tools were used to predict the interacting sites between scFv-A4 and HCK and then the results were combined with the peptide array membrane experiment results to build the 3D models of the binding complex. In complex model-II, the binding position of scFV-A4 was close to the two hydrophobic residues and actually formed a bulky protrusion (Figure 5b) , therefore for complex model-II, scFv-A4 bound to HCK would hinder the aggregation of HCK by steric effects.Webb [37] found that the C-terminal portion of the chick CK (GLY215 to LYS380) was much more resistant to digestion than the N-terminal portion (PRO1 to GLY133), and the middle of the HCK sequence (ARG134 to ARG214) was most sensitive to proteolysis.

Title: Efficient oligonucleotide probe selection for pan-genomic tiling arrays 
Summary: To summarize the new approach, let the pan-genome G be the set of all genomes from a species, and let P be the non-redundant set of all length k substrings from G. Due to sequence conservation between genomes, a single probe may match to multiple locations (genomes) of the pan-genome. Let P be the non-redundant set of length k substrings from G. A probe candidate p ∈ P is said to hit a window w ∈ W if a match between p and a substring of G begins in the interval w. Let P i ⊆ P be the subset of probes that hit the window w i , and F = {P 1 , P 2 ,..., P m } for the m windows of W. A minimum hitting set H of F is a minimum cardinality subset of probes H ⊆ P such that every window of the pan-genome is hit by at least one probe in H. Therefore, finding H effectively tiles the entire pangenome using a small number of probes.

Summary: The present study devised a novel prediction model to quantify the risk of experiencing a MERS case importation for countries around the world by using data on the arrival time of MERS cases, the global airline transportation network, religion, and the incidence data in Saudi Arabia. The hazard was assumed as an inverse function of the effective distance calculated from the airline transportation data, and religion and the incidence data of MERS in Saudi Arabia were supplemented to improve the model prediction.

Title: Estimating Infection Attack Rates and Severity in Real Time during an Influenza Pandemic: Analysis of Serial Cross-Sectional Serologic Surveillance Data 
Summary: To assess the logistical requirements and expected performance of serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance for future pandemics, we first estimated the number of specimens that would have allowed reliable estimates of IHP for pdmH1N1 by mid-August 2009 (4 wk before the epidemic peak), assuming that the incidence and seroprevalence curves in the full model were accurate. In this range of doubling time, the performance of sero-surveillance was largely similar when the delay between the start of sero-surveillance and epidemic seeding varied from 14 to 42 d. Given that the average delay from illness onset to seropositivity was around 9.6 d, it would be impossible for serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance to yield accurate estimates of IHP during the nascent stage of the epidemic if the epidemic doubling time was very short ( Figure 5 ).

Summary: In contrast to the transitions to State POST and to State FC, where the reverse intersubunit rotation is realized by the movement of the 30S subunit relative to the tRNA-mRNA complex with the 50S subunit being fixed to the tRNAs and by the movement of the 50S subunit relative to the tRNAs with the 30S subunit being fixed to the tRNA-mRNA complex, respectively, in the transition to State LP the reverse intersubunit rotation is realized by the movements of both the 30S and 50S subunits relative to the mRNA. The single-molecule experimental data [29] showed that at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA 24 ) of the WT mRNA, where both the SD-antiSD interaction and the downstream hairpin are present, the occurrence probability of the long-paused rotated state is 75%; for the mutant mRNA without the internal SD sequence, which corresponds to ΔΔE SD ¼0 in Eq.

Viruses are intracellular pathogens where a strong cellular immune response is needed, and in the case of both groups, we infer that an increase of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 and Th1 cytokines IFNγ and IL-2 took place between the time of entrance of the pathogen to the organism and the development of pneumonia, which is demonstrated by the lymphoproliferation detected at the moment of pneumonia and slight decrease at resolution when the blood draw was taken.

Title: O P I N I O N Genomics and infectious disease: a call to identify the ethical, legal and social implications for public health and clinical practice 
Summary: The development and implementation of informed consent policies and practices for the public health uses of WGS information will need to consider (1) whether the information that people ought to have in the context of infectious disease prevention, control and management is different in ethically relevant ways from what is provided in the context of other diseases and behavioral traits, and (2) whether the processes for disclosing information about host genomics should vary, for example, in different parts of the world. As our knowledge of the role of pathogen and host genomic factors in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease expands, it is critical that we evaluate current legal frameworks to determine the extent to which current genetic privacy laws -for example, both state and federal in the US -may hinder our ability to use genetic information to protect the health of both individuals and the general public.

Title: China's shifting neglected parasitic infections in an era of economic reform, urbanization, disease control, and the Belt and Road Initiative 
Summary: As highlighted above, there are three major themes to China's neglected parasitic infections: (1) as nationwide control performed in China, STHs and schistosomiasis have significantly declined, however, STH infections still remain highly prevalent in China's southwest due to persistent poverty; (2) increases in food-borne helminth infections in northern and southern provinces; and (3) imported tropical infections, led by falciparum malaria. They include continued disease prevalence reductions due to further decrease in poverty (especially rural poverty) but also new factors that could promote disease emergence, including the rise of urbanized helminth infections as noted elsewhere; continued food insecurity, especially in terms of its impact on food-borne trematodiases and other helminth infections; and China's Belt and Road initiative in terms of its reintroduction of malaria and other tropical infections.

Title: Pathogenesis of Lassa Fever 
Summary: Upon infection, once the virus RNP is delivered into the cytoplasm of the host cell, the L polymerase associated with the viral RNP initiates transcription from the genome promoter located at the 3'-end of each genomic RNA segment, L and S. The 5' and 3' terminal 19 nt viral promoter regions of both RNA segments required for the recognition and binding by the viral polymerase [11] exhibit a high degree of conservation among arenaviruses. Apparently, failure to develop the cellular immune response that would control dissemination of LASV, which is indicated by high serum virus titers, combined with disseminated replication in tissues and absence of neutralizing antibodies, leads to the development of fatal Lassa fever [64] .

Title: Preventing the next 'SARS' -European healthcare workers' attitudes towards monitoring their health for the surveillance of newly emerging infections: qualitative study 
Summary: Healthcare workers' views on monitoring their absence and symptoms for the surveillance of emerging infections and their willingness to report During the discussions, a framework for a syndromic surveillance system was described to participants whereby absent staff, who suspected themselves of having a contagious illness, would be encouraged to report symptoms for daily monitoring and identification of potential outbreaks [12] . Economic and structural barriers for HCWs to manage their health, such as loss in income and staffing pressures will undermine the development of concepts for this type of surveillance, as it is based on encouragement and the responsibility of individual staff to report when unwell.

Title: Phospholipase A 2 in skin biology: new insights from gene-manipulated mice and lipidomics 
Summary: The discovery of sPLA 2 -IIF as a bona fide "epidermal sPLA 2 " in mice [26] has led to speculation that the skin phenotypes observed in PLA2-G2A-TG or PLA2G10-TG mice may reflect the fact that sPLA 2 -IIA or sPLA 2 -X mimics the intrinsic actions of sPLA 2 -IIF when artificially overexpressed in the skin, or that endogenous sPLA 2 -IIF is upregulated in the hyperplasic epidermis of these transgenic mice. Thus, although it is possible that sPLA 2 -IIA and sPLA 2 -X might participate in certain forms of skin pathology such as cancer, it is nonetheless likely that sPLA 2 -IIF is the primary sPLA 2 acting in the epidermis of both mice and humans under physiological conditions.

Title: Correcting the Actual Reproduction Number: A Simple Method to Estimate R 0 from Early Epidemic Growth Data 
Summary: This simplifies (1) to the so-called Euler-Lotka equation: Since the density function of the generation time, g(), represents the frequency of secondary transmissions relative to infection-age , we can write g() as: Replacing A() in the right-hand side of (3) by that of (4), an estimator of R 0 is obtained [9] : The estimation of R 0 is achieved by measuring the exponential growth rate r from the incidence data and also by assuming that g() is known (or separately estimated from empirical observation such as contact tracing data [12, 13] ). The present study proposed the use of the corrected actual reproduction number, R a , for statistical inference of R 0 based on incidence and known relative frequency of secondary transmissions (i.e., the generation time distribution) during the early growth phase of an epidemic.

Title: Feline and Canine Coronaviruses: Common Genetic and Pathobiological Features 
Summary: Subsequent recombination between these viruses led to the emergence of a new CCoV-II cluster (formerly named TGEV-like CCoVs), in which the N-terminus of the spike protein was highly similar to TGEV whereas the rest of the genome clustered with reference CCoV-II isolates ( Figure 1 ) [35] . The selection of mutations in the S protein may then have led to the appearance of viruses able to infect other host species by means of their cognate APN proteins, although all of them retained their capacity to use feline APN as a receptor in vitro.

Title: Combining Free Text and Structured Electronic Medical Record Entries to Detect Acute Respiratory Infections 
Summary: Because of the low incidence of ARI in this broad outpatient population (an average of 1.8% during our 6-month study period), these losses in specificity halved the positive predictive value (PPV) that had originally been obtained with CDA that used ICD-9 codes alone ( Table 6 , compare CDA 3 to CDA 12). Several factors, some of which have already been mentioned, may limit the generalizability of our results: 1) factors related to the performance of our study at the VA health care system: a) the veterans study population is mostly male and excludes the pediatric population, a key target for ARI surveillance [44] ; b) veterans health care utilization may differ from that observed in uninsured or privately insured individuals; c) clinical practices, documentation and coding habits by VA practitioners may differ from those observed in solo or group practices or in health systems subject to different financial or quality-control incentives; 2) factors related to our study period: optimal CDAs could differ outside the respiratory infection season, or during periods of heightened apprehension for an influenza epidemic; 3) factors related to our iterative CDA development process, which may have over adapted CDAs to VA's particular EMR implementation and to our sample dataset in particular, this despite our efforts to maintain a separation between development and validation data subsets; 4) factors related to our text mining approach: a) we did not employ a spell checker prior to applying the NegEx algorithm.

Title: Immunoglobulin Superfamily Virus Receptors and the Evolution of Adaptive Immunity 
Summary: Similarities in mechanisms of ligand engagement by IgSF pathogen receptors and immunoglobulins, coupled with the evolution of the immunoglobulin fold prior to the existence of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, suggest the possibility that primitive members of the JAM/CTX and nectin families evolved to become soluble adaptive immune mediators in modern vertebrates. The evolution of JAM family members prior to the biochemical means to efficiently and extensively diversify antigen receptor genes, along with the structural similarities in the binding surfaces of virus receptors and immunoglobulins, provides strong support for the contention that viruses and perhaps other pathogens that engage IgSF receptors contributed to the selection of humoral mediators of adaptive immunity.

Title: Infectious Disease Risk Across the Growing Human-Non Human Primate Interface: A Review of the Evidence 
Summary: To understand this process, it is necessary to keep in mind the long co-evolution of microorganisms and their hosts, the history of species evolution, the adaptation of pathogens to hosts in which they persist without seriously affecting their health, eventually if the transmission of the pathogen requires its transfer via an intermediate vector insect, the nature of the mutations that can allow the infectious pathogens to change host when they meet a new host, and the dynamics of encounters between different ecosystems. The risk will also vary depending on the frequency of contact, the time spent in close proximity with NHP, the prevalence of the microorganism in the NHP population, the route of transmission (direct or indirect), the ability of hosts to transmit the pathogen, the time of incubation, the number of secondary infections produced in a completely susceptible population by an infected individual-known as R 0 (basic reproduction ratio: for a pathogen to invade and spread, R 0 must be >1)- (200, 201) .

Summary: In order to find a less expensive and more effective antiviral combination to improve the prognosis of cats with FIP, peptides based on the putative HR2 of the S protein were designed and tested for their inhibitory effect, and the possible synergism of these peptides with other known anti-FCoV agent was investigated. To assess the toxicity of the five FCoV HR2 peptides designed in this study, six concentrations of each peptide, ranging from 6.25 μM to 200 μM, were used to treat fcwf-4 cells for 72 h, and the viability of the cells was evaluated.

Title: Airflow Dynamics of Coughing in Healthy Human Volunteers by Shadowgraph Imaging: An Aid to Aerosol Infection Control 
Summary: Hence, for the cough propagation distances and the 2-D projected area, the plots shown in Figure 3 only cover the airflow dynamic behavior until the airflow boundaries are no longer visible -or the cough goes off the edge of the mirror surface depending on the angle of the cough direction produced by individual volunteers. The CDC recommendation to use the arm or sleeve to block the cough airflow is presumably based on: 1) the impaction and entrapment of larger, more ballistic particles in the substance of the sleeve, so as not to land on any other person or surface (fomite) nearby; 2) the reduction in the velocity of the coughed airflow to limit the distance of dissemination; 3) coughing into their sleeves instead of their hands makes it less likely that any potentially infected mucus will be transferred to other people or surfaces from where it could be picked up others.

Summary: These opposite findings could be explained by the evidence that the topological properties of the co-expression networks may be influenced by different parameters, including the expression data or the similarity measures to evaluate the dependency between variables. Other centralities used to globally evaluate the structure of a network include: • Degree distribution: a function describing the proportion of nodes related to each observed degree • Modularity: evaluates the presence of modules, such as a group of nodes characterized by the tendency to form more connections within the group than outside [87] • Cluster coefficient: the ratio of the number of edges among a node and its neighbors and the maximum possible number of edges among all of them [72] • Motif/graphlet frequency: evaluates the presence of small subgraphs with a specific pattern that appear in a real-world network more frequently than in the relative random network [88] • Edge clustering coefficient: the ratio between the number of triangles (three nodes connected by three edges) including an edge, and the maximum number of possible triangles may include the edge [89] • Maximal Clique centrality: a property of a node taking into account the cliques (i.e, a subgraph in which each pair of nodes is connected) including the node [90] The simplest way to perform a network topological analysis by evaluating these centralities is through Cytoscape's plugins, such as CentiScaPe [83] and Net-workAnalyzer [91] , that provide the main basic methods to compute the topological properties of nodes, edges, and networks, both directed and undirected.

Summary: The bias in the nucleotide count led us to compare the codon usage of HCoV-NL63 with that of human mRNA ( Table 1 ). Evidence for such a "delayed" strand transfer is provided by the junction analysis of the M and N sg mRNAs, which clearly demonstrates that the nucleotides directly upstream of the core TRS are derived from the body TRS element and not from the leader.

Title: Blood immune transcriptome analysis of artificially fed dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves from birth to 7 days of age OPEN 
Summary: A number of interesting networks were highlighted as being enriched in the comparison of 48 h, including network 5, antimicrobial response, in which the majority of the genes were present at lower levels in the CL calves (Fig. In beef LF calves, comparison at 48 h versus 0 h highlighted the role of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as being over-represented, with the majority of genes upregulated at 48 h. The most noticeable increase to the expression of cytokines was observed in the LF crossbreed calves, with a large number of cytokines present at increased levels of abundance by 48 h. CXCL10 was present at 4 RFC and 28 RFC in the beef CL and LF calves respectively, at 48 h compared to 0 h. CXCL10 encodes a small IFNγ inducible pro-inflammatory cytokine linked to having significant function within the immune response, involved in T cell chemotaxis and in monocyte migration among many proposed functions 26 .

Title: BMC Infectious Diseases Anticipated and current preventive behaviors in response to an anticipated human-to-human H5N1 epidemic in the Hong Kong Chinese general population 
Summary: Respondents were asked how likely they would be to adopt the following preventive behaviors if a local human-to-human H5N1 outbreak (defined as "if 2-3 new human-to-human transmission of H5N1 cases were to be reported in Hong Kong") were to occur: face mask use in public venues, increased frequency of handwashing, avoidance of eating poultry, declaration of influenzalike illness (ILI) symptoms at border health checkpoints, the seeking of medical consultation immediately with the onset of a fever, face mask use in public venues when having ILI symptoms and compliance with any quarantine policies. With regard to the impact of the disease, 33% believed that there would be a major human-to-human H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in the coming year; 40.2% believed that it would have higher fatality as compared to SARS and 53.7% would be very worried about oneself or one's family members contracting the virus if an outbreak were to occur.

Title: BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making Modeling and detection of respiratory-related outbreak signatures 
Summary: To aid in the comparison of the dependencies across cities, the order of the time series model, as determined by choosing the autoregressive (p k and P k ) and moving average orders (q k and Q k ), will be the same for each city k. We now propose a simple stochastic model for an inhalational anthrax outbreak, based on the work of Buckeridge, et al. Removing the non-stationary part due to the estimated effect of the covariates yields By applying the filter to this series we obtain the detection process that we would observe in the presence of extra counts attributable to an outbreak: To examine the effect of the filter upon the outbreak signature we examine the standardized quantity for the filters that we defined previously.

Title: Spatiotemporal Infectious Disease Modeling: A BME-SIR Approach 
Summary: The proposed modeling of the combined space-time distributions X p , Y p , Z p is described by the following generalized SIR model in continuous time (for the discrete time case, see [19] and references therein), where q s,t is the population fraction that resides (i.e., does not displace from) at the space-time domain p~(s,t), 1{q s,t is the fraction that migrates during the time period t?tzdt, d s{u is the delta function, and k s{s',t is a spatially homogeneous kernel (e.g., Gaussian kernel with finite variance) that controls population movement across space, with spatial integral being equal to 1{q s,t . In the present case, disease evolution is governed by the space-time SIR model (1a-c); therefore, g includes the mean, covariance and cross-covariance functions of X p , Y p , and Z p derived from the theoretical space-time SIR model (1a-c) to account for disease trends and correlation patterns in the population at different geographical locations and during different time periods.

The clinical outcome of mice infected with A. baumannii and S. aureus was more favourable when compared to infection with S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae [38] which may be explained by the lack of bacterial spreading throughout the thoracic cavity and adjacent tissues, and possibly sepsis.

Title: RNA and DNA Bacteriophages as Molecular Diagnosis Controls in Clinical Virology: A Comprehensive Study of More than 45,000 Routine PCR Tests 
Summary: We present results obtained by using T4 and MS2 bacteriophages as ICs in a routine-based evaluation including  Important criteria for the design of ECs include (i) the possibility to use quantified or semi quantified controls (in order to manage the detection level of the diagnostic test used), (ii) the possibility to distinguish amplicons obtained from ECs from those obtained from the detected pathogen (in order to detect false positives due to accidental amplification of EC) and (iii) the use of relevant nucleic acids (ie, RNA and DNA molecules for RNA and DNA viruses, respectively). The detection of EV and CMV in serial dilutions of supernatant cell culture media or in series of positive clinical samples spiked with T4-MS2 mix was performed and the comparison of the Ct values showed that neither the addition of the phage mix itself (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.18 for CMV and 0.45 for EV), nor the presence of phage-specific primers and probe in the reaction mix (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.77 for CMV and 0.18 for EV) did interfere with the Ct value associated with viral detection in Two-step (Table 2 and 3) and One-step rt-PCR.

These OPN fragments, which by inference must bear the intact thrombin-sensitive site, are probably truncated somewhere at the N-terminal end of the protein based on the observation that two immunoassays used in parallel with the mAb 659 inhibition ELISA had failed to detect similar OPN increases in the cancer patients: (1) An inhibition ELISA which uses mAb 446 as the detecting reagent known to bind to the N-terminal half of OPN (actual location unknown).

Title: Flocked nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate for detection of respiratory tract viruses in immunocompromised adults: a matched comparative study 
Summary: As the swab has been suggested to be comparable with NPA [1, 4, 9] , the primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of detecting respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adults using a flocked nasal swab (fNS) in the outer part of the nose cavity compared to NPA. Even though not statistically significant, the Ct value negatively correlated to the number of cells collected, and thus, the finding of NPA being superior to the fNS in collecting cells invite us to speculate that the fNS sometimes may collect inadequate amount of specimen in order to reach the PCR method's detection limit.

Title: Oral immunization with a novel attenuated Salmonella Gallinarum encoding infectious bronchitis virus spike protein induces protective immune responses against fowl typhoid and infectious bronchitis in chickens 
Summary: The IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines were 3.5, 5 and 4 folds, respectively, higher in JOL2077 vaccinated chickens compared to the JOL2068 control chickens, which showed non-significant and comparable levels to that of the PBS control chickens. To investigate whether JOL2077 vaccine delivering S1 protein can induce SG-specific protective immune responses, three groups of chickens were separately maintained and vaccinated with PBS, JOL2068 or JOL2077, and 4 weeks later SG-specific IgG and sIgA responses were measured in serum and intestinal wash samples, respectively ( Figure 5 ), Our results demonstrated that chickens vaccinated with either JOL2068 or JOL2077 elicited significantly (p < 0.05) higher both systemic IgG and sIgA responses compared to the PBS control group.

Title: Discovery of a Bovine Enterovirus in Alpaca 
Summary: The gene for the polymerase enzyme (which the virus uses to transcribe its RNA after infection of a cell) is also highly conserved among the enteroviruses and cannot be used to clearly delineate a serotype for the alpaca-sourced virus, which still clusters most closely with the EV-F species (Figure 8 ), with amino acid identity greater than 97% for serotypes 1-3 and 94% for serotype 4. While the enterovirus infection described in this report was temporally associated with illness in three other alpaca in the affected herd that may have represented limited spread of the virus, the sparse distribution of alpaca, together with the severe and rapid course of disease likely prevented further dissemination of the virus, as evidenced by the absence of other reports of similar illnesses in the herd or other alpaca in the region.

Summary: Therefore, while the observed decrease in sjTREC concentration (figure 2) can be a consequence of modifications of circulating T-cell homeostasis, the decline of the sj/bTREC ratio observed during the first months of IFNa therapy (figure 3) defines changes in thymocyte proliferation, thus in thymic output [28] . The reduction of IL-7 plasma levels while lymphocytopenia establishes under IFNa therapy, the absence of a correlation between IL-7 plasma levels and CD127 expression and the concomitance of decreases in IL-7 plasma levels and HCV viral load under therapy suggest that viremia might be driving IL-7 production before initiation of therapy.

Summary: These results were interpreted to mean that the exterior of the feedbags had become contaminated with PEDV in the barn during the outbreak; however, since PEDV was detected in the interior of the unopened bags of the new supplier's pellets, PEDV contamination of this feed had to occur prior to delivery at the barn. Because the timing of this outbreak coincided with a switch to new out-sourced feed pellets and due to the strong evidence provided by PEDV positive RT-PCR results of these feed pellets at both the swine operation and the supplier, it is believed that contaminated feed pellets were the source of this outbreak.

To determine if the performance gains observed with SARIMA in all-synthetic contexts would translate into meaningful real-world benefits, we modified the simulations in two ways: 1) we ran previously validated ARI CDAs on a repository of our own EMR data to generate authentic historical time series of ARI cases [8] ; 2) we modeled an epidemic of severe influenza centered in Baltimore to create an ARI outbreak that could plausibly be experienced by our health system.

Title: Contrasting Patterns in Mammal-Bacteria Coevolution: Bartonella and Leptospira in Bats and Rodents 
Summary: In order to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of Bartonella and Leptospira in bat and rodent hosts, we compiled available genetic information from hosts and bacterial pathogens to determine cophylogenetic patterns on a global scale. We note that the sample sizes for Bartonella in New World rodents and Leptospira in Old World bats are both small, and that the observed patterns could change with the addition of more data.

Title: Health-related quality of life in intensive care survivors: Associations with social support, comorbidity, and pain interference 
Summary: We found statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in PCS for the ICU survivors compared with the normative population at both 3 months and 1 year after ICU discharge, but only a minor reduction in MCS. One explanation for the finding that social support decreased from 3 months to 1 years, is that at 3 months, the ICU survivors were still in a rehabilitation situation, during which family and friends might have been aware that social support was more important, whereas at 1 year, this need for support may have normalized, and friends and family would likely have shifted It is difficult to compare our SPS and individual provision scores with other studies in which the original SPS was used, because the instruments have different maximum scores.

Title: Precision public health to inhibit the contagion of disease and move toward a future in which microbes spread health 
Summary: We suggest that this definition of the human exposome misses vital elements of what matters and the definition could usefully be extended in two related ways: 1) It should explicitly include microbes and chemicals sourced directly from other humans which probably are a major contributor in many circumstances and 2) The exposome should be understood as a reciprocal and interactive process to account for the fact that each individual is both a source and a sink of microbes and chemicals. A data-driven dilemma in the future of public health ethics Public health, with reference to microbiology, utilizes several streams of data all of which are subject to improvements whose combined information have the potential to be synergistic: 1) identification and quantification of microbes, their locals of growth, metabolism, evolution, carriers, and 2) mapping the physical parameters that contribute to microbial survival and dissemination.

Title: Respiratory Research Dynamic changes of serum SARS-Coronavirus IgG, pulmonary function and radiography in patients recovering from SARS after hospital discharge Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)SARS-CoV IgG antibodyPulmonary functionPulmonary fibrosisAvascular necrosis of femoral head 
Summary: The present study focused on the dynamic changes in the IgG antibody levels against SARS-CoV and in lung lesions in the discharged but recovering SARS patients as measured by lung function and imaging tests. Follow-up surveys of SARS patients in the convalescent phase are needed for recognizing the clinical characteristics of this disease and reevaluation of the therapeutic treatments [2, 7] .

Title: Consequences of delays and imperfect implementation of isolation in epidemic control 
Summary: Our first result is that when the isolation probability is p and identification time is τ, the effective disease reproductive number r ε becomes The number ε can be thought of as the response capability of the affected community. Observe that ε, the response capability, not only determines whether or not a small outbreak can be contained, it influences strongly the eventual endemic state when the outbreak happens: S eq , the fraction of the population (2019) 9:3505 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39714-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that remains healthy in the eventual endemic steady state, is inversely proportional to (1 − ε), and the fraction I eq can be rewritten as Observe in the numerators of the quantities above that r ε = 1, equivalently ε − = 1 r 1 , is the tipping point on one side of which the initial outbreak is contained and on the other the system tends to an endemic equilibrium with I eq > 0.

Title: Identification of VP1 peptides diagnostic of encephalomyocarditis virus from swine 
Summary: In order to map the minimal sequences of the epitopes recognized by McAbs, the series of truncated recombinant proteins were used in Western blot was to identify the reactivity of each of 10 anti-VP1 McAbs. In this study, ten monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the VP1 of EMCV were prepared by inoculated with the purified killed EMCV, and then three minimal epitopes [V (2)ENAEK(7), F(19)VAQPVY (25) , and P(42)IGAFTVK (49)] were identified in N terminus of the EMCV VP1, using these McAbs and a series of recombinant truncated VP1.

Title: Respiratory Research Persistence of lung inflammation and lung cytokines with high-resolution CT abnormalities during recovery from SARS 
Summary: At 60 days, 5 SARS patients were found with an HRCT abnormality of <10 % of the total lung field. At 60 days, compared to normal subjects, there was a significant increase in total cell counts in BAL fluid from SARS patients (Table 3 ) with a significant increase in alveolar macrophages (AM) and lymphocytes., The proportion of CD8+ T cells was increased to a greater extent than CD4+ T cells, leading to a significant decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio (Table 4 ).

Title: Improved survival rates in patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure in Korea between 2009 and 2016 
Summary: In this study, we investigated whether survival had improved in patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure because of advances in ICU management and sought to identify which treatment modalities had been used during an epidemic in 2016 and a pandemic in 2009. In this study, it was notable that tidal volumes for predicted body weight were significantly lower in patients receiving ECMO in 2016 than in those in 2009, which might explain the improved survival.

Title: Oncotarget, Supplementary Materials 2017 
Summary: To study the mechanism of interference exerted on eIF4E/Hsp27 binding, compound 14 was docked into the eIF4E binding pocket, and the MM/PBSA scoring was again applied to estimate the affinity of 14 for eIF4E. Finally, the ternary complex Hsp27/14/eIF4E was built by docking the MD Hsp27 model onto the last frame of the eIF4E/14 complex extracted from the corresponding equilibrated MD trajectory.
